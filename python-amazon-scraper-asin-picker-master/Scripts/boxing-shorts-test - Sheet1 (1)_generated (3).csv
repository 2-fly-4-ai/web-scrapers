I compared the two size charts and the measurements were mostly similar. I wear an XL in TUFF so I assumed I\'d be XL with this one. That wasn\'t the case as the XL fit like baggy basketball shorts on me, so I returned for a Medium. Much better fitting and can still execute kicks during drills and sparring. Have only done two training sessions in them so far so I\'ll see how they hold up. But my a lot of my training partners seem to have the same shorts (just in different colours) and there\'s no complaints from them.Very satisfied, but I\'d definitely recommend the company to tweak the sizing chart. Other than that, I\'m very happy!UPDATE (04/08/22):The vendor messaged me personally saying they\'d re-look into the sizing chart, thanked me for feedback.

The sizing seems small so I recommend ordering one size up plus that will really help with their loose fit throughout the seat.

While the shorts reach my kneecaps in length, they are a tight fit around my waist. The adult medium is supposed to fit waist sizes between 34-39 inches. However, this is not a problem. These shorts also don't have pockets, so it's probably best not to wear them if you plan on traveling to several places throughout the day.As the instructions indicate, it's for the best not to wash them in the washing machine. One should hand wash it for no more than 10 minutes. The fabric is weak; they feel like boxer briefs. Though, I don't mind it. However, you shouldn't wear them during weight training sessions. The sleeveless hooded jacket fit my body frame just fine. The stars on the sides of the shorts are so cool. These are the longest boxing shorts I've seen because they're like basketball shorts.

This made passing guards and sweeping mounts so much easier as my ""partner"" / enemy was intimidated after I would flex my muscles and smash them aimlessly into his face. This immediately propelled my skill level far above what it was before. I was so satisfied that I bought 3 more sets of matching LAFROI rash guards and shorts. Each time I showed up to the gym with a new set, my ""partners"" / enemies trembled in fear even more! The effects were cumulative, and now I am at least purple belt in skill level equivalent, and even have subbed coach when I flexed especially hard on his face. I highly recommend these shorts. I think they are the best performance enhancing clothes your money can buy and they are only around $20! In fact, after I started wearing them 24/7, to work, on the street, to the grocery store, and to a wedding, I noticed the effects didn\'t only apply to jiu jitsu. Everyone began to be intimidated by me! I get to skip all lines, people throw money at me in the street, women tremble in fear as I talk to them (this is now part of my ""player style""), and I even got a raise for 3x my old salary just by having a quick ""chat"" with my boss.

A trick i found with all of my shorts regardless of brand to get some more give in the waist is to remove the tag in the front, unless you're just really looking to advertise the logo this gives a little more stretch.

Of course, the time of their lives was because of their high quality Calvin Klein boxer briefs and Under Armor compression shorts. 2 years had gone by living with the agony and distress of only wearing boxers. I was 15, and thought I should be hitting the weight room soon. I Before I got to the gym my first day, I expected to see others that looked just like me working out. When I got there, my heart deflated. Others were wearing similar athletic shorts, and a cutoff or short sleeve shirt. But I could tell that wasn\'t it. Just observing the way they walked, they way they talked, how they interacted with others, I could tell without a second thought that each and every one of them were wearing compression shorts. I, of course, was the only one wearing boxers. Things just weren\'t working out in my teen years. I was 16, and starting to take more control of the decisions I made in life. I had just recently entered my payment method onto my Amazon account, and was buying things such as biographies for history class, accessories for my camera, and other small things. I was at a friends house playing ultimate frisbee. We decided that it would be shirts vs. skins, and my team was skins. I removed my shirt, and let the beautiful beams of sunlight run through my skin. It was a great game of frisbee, until I looked down to see my boxers showing from under my ""The Come Sail Aways"" shorts by Chubbies. The past 3 years of my life flashed through my head and down my nerves to make ever nook and cranny feel a shiver, and I sprinted a straight for miles back to my own home. I got there, Opened my computer and went straight to the amazon website. I had no idea what I was doing at the time, but I knew it was right. I clicked the search box, paused for a second, closed my eyes and took a deep breath. The words flowed through my fingers like florida sand into the search box: ""Compression Shorts"". I scrolled through the results clicked on the \'Champion Men\'s Powerflex Compression Short\', and checked out. The old expression, ""No guts, no glory"", may seem like an old folk song to some, but when you witness something that calls upon a substantial amount of bravery, the four words have an exceeding depth of meaning.

I had owned a pair of XL champion compression shorts in the past which fit me but were not as tight as I personally like, so I sized down with this order.In terms of quality, for about $12 a pair I think these are a very good value. They're very light weight, soft, with a comfortable waist band and no stitching or tags that feel annoying. They're not thick material, they're really more of an undergarment than a true compression short. But I only needed something that was very stretchable and 100% non restrictive, and these fit the bill for me in that regard. I wear these as bottoms while weight training with nothing else, there's no fly and they don't become see-through when stretched, so I think they're fine when used as an outergarment. I could care less about appearance in the gym, I wanted something that was functional with deep squats and deadlifts, these shorts work perfectly for me."", 'reviewer': 'LT', 'purchase_type': 'Verified Purchase', 'reviewer_rating': 5.0, 'reviewer_location': 'the United States', 'review_date': '2015-05-31'}, {'header': 'These are my favorite.

For these, if you are about a 36 in most products, I personally find the XL to be the most comfortable, but to each their own. If you are a 34-36 I would go with a Large vs. a Medium, again, just out of comfort and not be wearing a product that was overly tight or constricting but the value and quality are amazing with these.

They may all just be me issues...let's call them minor annoyances than cons:-The drawstring is just...weird-Also I have to put the velcro on over my belly button, where it seems to fit but then I can slide them down to my waist or so? But can't put them on velcro and all over my waist? Maybe that's my body size (Female, wide hips) but again, minor annoyance I can work around it.ALSO THE CLEANING LABEL: I know it says hand wash, or implies it, but you can toss these bad boys in a cold water wash and hang dry. I do this twice a week or so when I toss them in with my BJJ stuff, they've held up just fine. If you have a delicates setting on your washer and you're hesitant, use that.

He prob. could have fit a large- but, XL will provide room to fill out on his athletic grind of late! At least he’ll be doing so without losing his gear- Yay!! Didnt realize short had dual zip pockets so, a total bonus! Pocket is just wide enough to fit a cell phone and has no issue fitting ID/debit size wallet and/or key fob for sure! Zipper’s smooth like butter and doesn’t catch on edges- shorts really have a lot of attention to quality and detail.Mine wears like underwear with basketball shorts and they hug nice to body allowing him to do so w/out excess bulk.. fit is ideal he also pairs under his adidas athletic pant without issue. The slick and soft material is non irritating and provides support in all the right places lending confidence to keep junk in its place- without the look of revealing too much!

On one leg you see how long shorts are and the other how long these compression shorts are.They zipper pockets are on each hip front side of body. You can put key fob, ID, credit card or gym card and not worry about losing it. I\'d suggest maybe a plastic bag for your key fob to keep sweat from seeping into touch pads. Yeah gross, but that is number one killer of key fobs, well that and putting it thru the washing machine. Just my opinion. I believe YouTube has a video on how to clean your key fob.I had my brother model them and well, I think that is the only real shot Amazon will allow. They feel like underwear but if you are comfortable and have the body for it, you can wear it like you would bicycle shorts in public.I don\'t feel comfortable wearing them in public. That is just me.What I do like about these? If you are traveling in foreign countries you can wear these under your regular pants/shorts and use the zipper pockets to ""Hide"" some valuables. Would prevent being pick pocketed. My friends sister wanted these for their trip to Europe but they were too big for them.For now, I think my brother will be using these. He goes to the gym and runs often. Said these are perfect for that. He\'s a bit younger than I am and has the confidence to wear these out in public. Not me so much!
