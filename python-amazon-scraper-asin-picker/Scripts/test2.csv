The design caught my attention. I am 6'2'' and I have about a 30 inch waist. I was debating on whether or not I should buy the adult medium or adult large. In the end, I chose the adult medium. While the shorts reach my kneecaps in length, they are a tight fit around my waist. The adult medium is supposed to fit waist sizes between 34-39 inches. However, this is not a problem. These shorts also don't have pockets, so it's probably best not to wear them if you plan on traveling to several places throughout the day.As the instructions indicate, it's for the best not to wash them in the washing machine. One should hand wash it for no more than 10 minutes. The fabric is weak; they feel like boxer briefs. Though, I don't mind it. However, you shouldn't wear them during weight training sessions. The sleeveless hooded jacket fit my body frame just fine. The stars on the sides of the shorts are so cool. These are the longest boxing shorts I've seen because they're like basketball shorts. They look like they're hard to keep clean, so take good care of them. As long as you purchase the correct size, I highly recommend this product.""}]","[{'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oCc3sTLGL._AC_UL1100_.jpg', 'path': 'Tracksuit-Sleeveless-Boxing-Jacket-Trunks-1.jpg', 'checksum': '69d184d7ceaa8290b181eec4299abdda', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d9VgmLq3L._AC_UL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Tracksuit-Sleeveless-Boxing-Jacket-Trunks-2.jpg', 'checksum': '88fb9507b5ff69faa280ddd0a924000f', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614FFgYd+OL._AC_UL1100_.jpg', 'path': 'Tracksuit-Sleeveless-Boxing-Jacket-Trunks-3.jpg', 'checksum': 'ac721888c7957fc4e2487719810c9362', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lg2bBUzcL._AC_UL1100_.jpg', 'path': 'Tracksuit-Sleeveless-Boxing-Jacket-Trunks-4.jpg', 'checksum': '184413cb76670e347fd8ba65fbb24de3', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714YYEDpfAL._AC_UL1100_.jpg', 'path': 'Tracksuit-Sleeveless-Boxing-Jacket-Trunks-5.jpg', 'checksum': '89828ef1714535b128470938ba66ea27', 'status': 'uptodate'}]",Hoodie + Shorts$$$Shorts Only,Black Boxing Shorts,"B01G42SCVG,B09WF1WG48,B0895NM2KC,B006CV3QZW,B01JYO4BCU,B08HZGQ1M5,B07ZPWJN5Y,B08F29Y9TK,B08C2ZWRB4,B09339Y5GH,B099F2W189,B07LG3QQC2,B001GJQQY8,B082Q6BGMG,B07BS4CB81,B077XK3GXF,B07S3DK5YN,B01INDB1F8,B07XJDX2GF,B07HPC8JDV,B07QKSNCYS,B01N2LIE4U,B00EYVSV6Q,B098MNQX6Q,B09C8V8LRB,B07TYZ8WB8,B07TQ73XKS,B07PZ55FLN,B075KL6Q1C,B0763LFBCT,B07Z4GDPWV,B09ZNXTLXB,B07SH7VS7G,B084G7CGXS,B07R71TWSX,B07CHYHZ69,B08CRX5Y22,B004WWTX6O,B01MDOYEQL,B01015XXJS,B00CS6R12E,B084DLB4QC,B07ZKXPYGB,B07LGXFVPV,B0B341YM9H,B07NS1VTRT,B089M9N915,B09BRDXQV4,B07DHRBZ8P,B06XRKVCYK,B01GBMKY4C,B08NYJTVNL,B083QH2GBB,B07N737M1W,B081R2CMZ9,B01IFD30GE,B0874W7Z6B,B078Y4PB28,B07DLXL11C,B07H53M74Z,B01MUEC8HA,B07NQQ9MWL,B092HDYNPY,B015SSVBGA,B09Q344RWL,B09DCC7QJB,B07R8674TN,B0036OS6KS,B07SHC61DR,B08RD85ZFC,B09CY96WWQ,B09RQRS7S1,B06W2K9P2M,B0822TBMG8,B07PXJKM7J,B07L9JBHXL,B07S3JWDBF,B0889PKVCK,B012U0AZZW,B004LVNN4O,B082FNPCYX,B00SZD6986,B09S4JR1R5,B09P789GMP,B07S2PSFZX,B088Y9C1RC,B09229YPR3,B085YWJ2GW,B09VPBY572,B0046XIHSO,B01CCL2EU8,B09Z2BHZSR,B071Z644CZ,B01MEGL9ZG,B09J4R5Q4P,B096LWZZKD,B006C75SUC,B097F639J3,B07LHCT43V,B09MR19HYR",,,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R8674TN,,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d9VgmLq3L._AC_UL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614FFgYd+OL._AC_UL1100_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lg2bBUzcL._AC_UL1100_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714YYEDpfAL._AC_UL1100_.jpg",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oCc3sTLGL._AC_UL1100_.jpg
