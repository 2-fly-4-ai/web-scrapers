They may all just be me issues...let's call them minor annoyances than cons:-The drawstring is just...weird-Also I have to put the velcro on over my belly button, where it seems to fit but then I can slide them down to my waist or so? But can't put them on velcro and all over my waist? Maybe that's my body size (Female, wide hips) but again, minor annoyance I can work around it.ALSO THE CLEANING LABEL: I know it says hand wash, or implies it, but you can toss these bad boys in a cold water wash and hang dry. I do this twice a week or so when I toss them in with my BJJ stuff, they've held up just fine. If you have a delicates setting on your washer and you're hesitant, use that.
