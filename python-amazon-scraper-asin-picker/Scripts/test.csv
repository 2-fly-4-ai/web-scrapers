This carseat is super nice, material feels nice and thick. This car seat will definitely keep your baby comfortable & safe. My last child was 5 years ago and we had got a Graco car seat and travel system. That specific carseat was not as nice as this at all! The material on that carseat was cheap, barely any padding and felt hard. This chicco car seat is very padded and over all 10x better. It’s also not that heavy as other reviews have said. The only thing I would say that needs improvement is the canopy it’s stiff and hard to pull forward when the carry bar is up. Besides that excellent seat and better than the competition.'}, {'header': 'Safe & Functional', 'body': 'We love this carrier!! No feet that our little one isn’t safe. It’s easy to use. We like that the fabric is clean of chemicals and is suitable for extra weight and length that other carriers are not. It’s heavier than some on the market but we don’t mind. It’s a solid set and that was more important to us after seeing the styrofoam layer in the NUNA we couldn’t justify the price or feel it was safest. Doesn’t hurt that it’s a middle of the road price point and attached with ease to our Vista V2. Also like that it comes with a base, others can be purchased or omitted and installed into someone else’s car in a pinch. Helpful when we leave it with family knowing if there was an emergency they can easily buckle it into the car without a base.'}, {'header': 'Great Car seat', 'body': 'I haven’t been able to use this yet because I’m due next month but I am very impressed with the quality. Great cushion and I don’t think I’m going to have to worry about him over heating. I’m glad I went with this one'}, {'header': 'Worth the investment', 'body': 'This seat is well worth the investment to have something that is extremely safe, easy to use, looks sharp, and will outlast other systems with its slightly higher weight rating. The learning curve on using this seat is very easy, and installation is a snap once you’ve sorted out the latch points in your vehicle for the base, which is included. There are also easy-to-follow instructions for installation without the base, if you may be traveling in someone else’s vehicle. The interoperability with stroller systems is very nice as well. The sun shade is nice and much bigger than expected and does a very good job of protecting our girl from the sun, especially in combination with the stroller system: the two combined interlock and provide 100% coverage. The seat is going to start showing markings quickly: every bump and every rub will leave a mark, but it is cosmetic and isn’t a big deal, and most can be cleaned off with a damp rag. Overall, the travel system is a solid set and a good choice for people willing to spend the money for a solid, reliable, and safe system over a bargain product.The major con is that it is a little large: while it isn’t too heavy, the size and latch positioning make it a little difficult to take out of smaller cars. Our mid-size sedan requires us to move the passenger seat back and forth to accommodate space to unlatch the car seat. However, this is a trade off we expected for getting a car seat designed to last longer, and so it isn’t something I would lower a rating because of. It alto requires two hands to hit two switches in order to adjust the handle position, and the handle is a tight fit over the sun shade, but these issues really only occur when the seat is empty or else you’re finishing putting it in or about to take it out of the car, in which case you should have both hands free anyway. Again, the safety this adds is f the handle not accidentally swinging free while carrying it outweighs the challenge this provides.'}, {'header': 'Fantastic!', 'body': ""I normally wouldn't buy a car seat without seeing it in person, however, I seen this one and went with my gut. I was so excited to actually get it and see it...I definitely made a good choice. It looks comfortable, as the material on the inside is soft and squishy. It was easy to install, and I just know once my little boy arrives that he'll be safe in his new seat.""}, {'header': 'I wish I could give 10 stars!!!', 'body': ""I just received the carseat yesterday and can't stop admiring it. Chicco keyfit 35 eco fabric is just amazing in quality. I got it in grey and is gorgeous. Top notch high-end quality and workmanship. The fabric is so smooth, non-toxic, thick and well-made. It looks very comfortable, well-cushoned and sturdy. Chicco is known for their high safety features. I am very impressed with the overall quality considering the price. I got it on a discount with additional baby registry 15% off which was a steal!!! I previously had ordered Cybex Aton smart carseat that was 2 times more expensive for the hype of smart technology it offers but ended up returning it due to synthetic poor-quality fabric and skimpy short canopy. After receiving this Chicco, I can't even compare the two. This is far better and high-end comparing to the Cybex and other carseats I have owned.

My husband and I do a lot of driving and like to go on road trips so we knew we wanted something super safe but also super comfortable for our baby.I probably spent the better part of a month trying to choose a carseat for my little guy, I was starting to drive myself (and my husband!) crazy. I think I now know just about everything there is to know about every carseat on the market. Haha. Not really, but it definitely feels like it! Anyway, I am SO glad that I chose this seat! It was incredibly easy to install (we have used it in seat belt and LATCH mode) and seems exceptionally comfortable for my baby. He was just 6 pounds and 7 ounces when we brought him home from the hospital and the infant insert was so cushy and comfy. He is currently 6 months old and still seems very comfortable. The straps and headrest are so easy to adjust and I am very confident that my son is safe in this seat. In addition to being safe and comfortable, the canopy and overall look of the carseat is also very high quality and I have had many other moms compliment how nice it is compared to their child's seat.

First, the grey color is beautiful, it remind me of granite stone and is gender neutral. It matches any car interior and the silky feeing of the fabric makes it easy to wipe down. The car seat is lightweight and so easy to install. I use to think that the heavier the car seat is - the better quality it is, but that isn't true. In addition, the lighter car seats are SO MUCH easier to install and carry around. I have a bad back and I just can't do the heavy seat anymore. In addition, the built in bubble level to check the angle of the seat installation is awesome!I also love the built in cup holder that doesn't stick out an extra 4 inches, some car seats have detachable cup holders that never stay on and stick out so far that there isn't space in the seat next to the car seat. This cup holder has a small footprint and is built in.For less than $100 this is a great car seat. It's safe, comfortable and oi easy to install (for me - as I have been installing car seats for my kids for over a decade). I didn't try to fit three of these car seats across the back, but my daughter sat in this seat for a 10 hour road trip with her two brothers in booster seats (not high-back) and they were comfortable in a small Mitsubishi SUV.Great seat for the price that will grow with your child - it fits 4lbs to 65lbs and after that transfer to a booster seat so this is seriously the only car seat you will need to buy.""}, {'header': 'Inexpensive, light, narrow....', 'body': ""I appreciate specific virtues in a car seat. This inexpensive car seat has several that are important, starting with its price. A reasonably-priced, NHTSA approved car seat is a fundamental priority. This Trooper model from Baby Trend is not yet in the NHTSA web site's listings, but many older Baby Trend models are, and this newer one will be soon, I'm sure.In addition to price, these are important as well:1) Grow with children. This can take your child from infancy to over 100 pounds, converting from a back-facing infant seat to a front facing child seat and ultimately to a booster seat.2) Narrow width--economical in use of space. This is a narrow seat. Three of these can fit abreast in the back seat of most cars--a rarity in modern, oversize car seats. If you have more than one child in a car seat, this is a great choice. Let me add, however, that when used as an infant seat with the seat back facing and reclined, this takes up a LOT of front to back room...3) Weight. This seat weighs just ten pounds.4) Cleanability. This seat has easily removable and cleanable paddingl HOWEVER, the padding cannot be machine washed.5) LATCH installation. Makes it easy to install...There are a variety of instructions on labels on the seat and a thorough instruction manual. For homes with lots of kids, this is a great car seat.""}, {'header': 'Perfect and great price', 'body': 'Great price and quality'}, {'header': 'Good', 'body': ""It really is more of a magenta color lol the reviews killed me on how many people said it wasn't red.

The Graco TrioGrow SnugLock LX 3-in-1 Car Seat installs in less than one minute using vehicle seat belt or LATCH. With SnugLock Technology, you can feel confident you've got a secure install as your child grows. Keep your little one safe from baby to big kid: this 3-in-1 car seat converts from a rear-facing harness (5-40 lb), to a forward-facing harness (22-65 lb), to a big kid highback booster (40-100 lb). Using the Simply Safe Adjust harness system, you can adjust the height of the harness and headrest to 10 positions in one motion, allowing you to easily get the safest fit for your child as he or she grows. Conveniently store the harness away in booster mode with the integrated harness storage compartment. The 6-position recline and removable infant head and body inserts help your little one feel cradled and comfortable on your many journeys together. When things get messy, the Rapid Remove cover comes off in 60 seconds, without removing the harness or uninstalling the car seat. But installation and harnessing are made easier with the Graco exclusive InRight LATCH system and fuss-free harness pockets keep the harness out of the way in both rear- and forward-facing harness modes. Two integrated cup holders keep drinks and snacks close at hand. The Graco TrioGrow SnugLock LX is ProtectPlus Engineered, which helps to protect your child in frontal, side, rear & rollover crashes.

And I didn’t have to climb in the seat and press with my knees, or strain my shoulders (I had rotator cuff surgery recently). It was so very easy, I wish I had purchased it weeks ago.I must say, I bought this seat at a big-box store, and I bought the regular seat, not the LX. For those of you who don’t need the push-button, InRight anchor latch, the more basic version averages $179.00 and has metal clips on the latch belt. The belt latches weren’t a dealbreaker for me, since I won’t be using this seat rear-facing. The seat is well-padded, but the padding isn’t quite as thick as the Graco 4-Ever DLX. It has two snap-in cup holders, and converts to a high-back booster when my grandson outgrows the harness. I can’t speak to how easy it would be to clean the seat, as I haven’t had to do that yet, but it doesn’t seem like it would be terribly7/7/2022: After a year, still really liking this seat. We recently had trouble with the crotch buckle sticking, and being very hard to fasten. I called Graco customer service, gave them the model #, and they sent me a new crotch buckle, free of charge. It was very easy to exchange the new buckle for the old one.'}, {'header': 'Amazing childs seat with steel reinforcement!', 'body': ""This is a great seat, it is safe, easy to use, and has a great tension lever arm latch. The last part feels a bit like it is a mouth full.Lets break it down. First I want to talk about the retention arm latch. It's steel reinforces with a steel latch. There is a bit of a caveat however, In that the pivot joint is not steel, it is a plastic part. The point of this is just to pivot, and to allow for retention on a already made tight belt. What worries me, is the amount of leverage the arm offers on this pivoting part. If you get into a crash, you needn't worry about initial tension anymore, you want be able to use any car seat after any major accident. If the car is totaled, so is the seat. Speaking of pivoting though, this arm pivots to offer tension on either rear or forward facing configurations. By the time I got this, my daughter was cleared to face forward so that will be the only way I use this from here on out. The latching arm does remind me of the Britax Clicktight that I am replacing. This seat is narrower than the click tight. This is actually good for me though, as I am fitting three seats together on a 96 Subaru Legacy Outback. Narrower is better.Moving on to another point, this is a steel frame. Steel frames are safer, last longer, don't expire as early as your standard plastic design, which will break down with time alone. There are plastic parts still that are structural, but these parts are reinforced with steel, this is why it can last longer.This seat does work from newborn to 100 pounds 57 inches. Honestly, I wouldn't use it for a newborn though, as a bucket style removable seat option is much easy to handle than removing a sleeping baby from a sleeping position. I also doubt this is the right option for a preterm baby.Some things I don't like, is how you have to lace the seat belt through, in this regard, the britax clicktight options are better. You can just slide them into place on the britax, making relocating the seat much easier. I also don't like that weak looking/feeling pivot joint on the tension arm used for the seat belt.Some things I like/love. Huge level of adjust-ability, easy to relocate crotch latch, steel reinforced from, and long life that can be used for all stages of growth up to just sitting in the seat without any booster. Also, the cup holders are really easy to install and are secure afterwards.Honestly, my britax is still serviceable, with only 4 years of use with my son before he got a different seat. I may just swap out the seats as the covers need cleaning. But I wanted the narrower seat so my son can practice buckling his own seatbelt.""}, {'header': 'The best and most safest seat', 'body': 'I bought this car seat at Burlington Coat Factory, it is by far the best car seat I have ever come across. I am a freak about my children’s seat being TIGHT in the car (that’s what keeps them alive in a wreck!). This one has a lock (hence the SNUGLOCK name) for the seatbelt to go through, which makes it so easy to install and uninstall. That’s my most favorite part of it. Another great part is how EASY it is to take it apart and clean it. Each piece of fabric has its own buttons that snap itself to other pieces and to the car seat itself. By far the best seat I could ask for, for the safety of my little ones. Thank you Graco. 💖'}, {'header': 'Safe and comfortable.', 'body': 'I do not have a baby but a friend does so I equipped my car for times when she travels with me.This was my first convertible car seat and I am not disappointed by it.It cost about twice as the car seats that my friend is using but after seeing the little one in this seat I think it is worth spending the money.First, the seat feels solid and doesn’t move around. The latch system on this seat is awesome and the snuglock works just as described. Compared to the ones that needs tightening by hand, the snuglock gives you that extra “click” to secure the seat properly.However, this comes at a cost – if you will be moving the seat from car to car you must lift the seat cushioning every single time to unlock and lock it.My friend has another seat (Evenflo Symphony Elite) and this seat provides the same secure fit by simply pushing down on the seat.Second, the padding for the baby is amazing. Especially on long trips (or any time the baby falls asleep) the head support is awesome. Compared with the other car seat where we had to prop the baby’s head with pillows and clothes and it still wouldn’t stay up, we don’t have to do any of this with this seat.There are other small things on this seat that make it great, but I don’t think it differs much from other competition. Removable and washable fabric as well as cupholders are pretty much on any seat nowadays, however, having a seat with cup holders is appreciable.In conclusion, I think this is an excellent seat for the baby and hopefully it will serve as well once the little one grows up a bit. I would recommend this seat, but if you plan on moving it from car to car you might want to look elsewhere, because there are other seats that offer the same snug fit and you don’t have to lift the seat every time.I would give this seat 4.5 stars (rounding up to 5)'}, {'header': 'I feel great having my grand kids in this seat.', 'body': ""I have never put much thought to features on a child's car seat. I always thought that if it was approved for use and safe, that was just OK with me. Well that was until I got this car seat. This thing has more options than my car seat. I also have to say that it is MUCH MUCH easier to handle and use than our old one. I had to fiddle with that old seat every time we used it, and somehow it never fit and worked quite like I had thought it should. But, hey, that is the nature of the beast I always thought. This Graco seat can be adjusted to fit any car/SUV/Truck, unless it is a two seat sports car. The tilt adjusts so easily with a big hand grip. The height adjusts the same way. The hand grip handles are so easy to use. You just grab them and pull, make your adjustment and let go. The inside of the seat automatically conforms when adjusting height. The security straps are adjusted with one pull and easily release. This thing even has two cup holders. The car seat is so well made and looks great. It makes me proud to have it. To make a long story short, this seat is so easy to put in and take out of my car. It is so easy to put the kids in and secure them. It is also easy to get them out and remove it from the car when not needed. Other car seat makers should take a lesson from Graco. Best of all, this seat will accompany my grand kids for a long time. It is well made and will last for years. Even better it will adapt to their needs and sizes as they grow. No need to buy even more seats as they grow out of them. One seat does it all. Great job. You can believe me when I say that this is a totally honest opinion. This seat is really great.""}, {'header': 'Terrific Convertible Car Seat', 'body': ""The TrioGrow SnugLock LX is yet another reminder of why Graco is known as the top car seat company out there. It's very easy to use, easy to install. The size is such that it's not too large or bulky for smaller vehicles, so that's a plus. Especially if you're using multiple car seats at once.We really like that it comes with infant head padding, so that smaller babies and newborns can fit comfortably. Plus you can remove the extra padding for your LO once they grow out of the need for it. The seat itself is pretty comfortable. Best of all, you can use this particular seat until your child is up to 100 lbs. So no need to go through multiple car seats. Get this one, and you're done until they no longer need one.We're extremely pleased with the different crash testing that was done on this seat. Obviously, we hope we never have to find out just how effective it is, and that no parent will ever have this seat put to the test. But we trust Graco, just like millions of other parents. So it's nice just having peace of mind when it comes to the comfort and safety of your LO. And I know it shouldn't really matter in the bigger picture, but we do like the look and color scheme.Definitely get one for yourself. This would also make an incredible baby shower gift. A little pricey as a gift? Maybe. But then, you can't put a price on the comfort and safety of those we love. Plus, it would be a gift that someone would appreciate and think about every time they click their LO in the seat. So we absolutely recommend it.""}, {'header': 'Love it!  So easy and convenient', 'body': 'This is probably one of my favorite Graco SnugLock car seats that I’ve tested so far. Mostly because how easy it is to get in and out of the car I didn’t even need my husband!We are thankfully out of the rear facing days so I only tested it with my two year old and my four year old. First, I am a huge fan of ease of installation!! We have a vehicle that has bucket seats with four kids so it’s easy for our boys to get in and out while our little girls are in their car seats. However, the bucket seats are somewhat a tight squeeze depending on the car seat.This one is not gigantic so it was easy to get in to either side and buckle in. It was so easy to adjust it in any way! Headrest, harness, all just one movement. The headrest has ten positions. The seat has 6 recline positions. It includes two cup holders which is actually a big plus for us because we really like to have one drink and one snack. They are a bit of a pain to clean out but we’ve also had worse.Both girls think they are comfortable in the second and third stages. They like them a lot. And of course Graco is one of the safest on the market. I haven’t had to personally test that part out but have friends that have so I trust the brand being well made.I definitely recommend this Graco TrioGrow SnugLock LX. I still say newborns should always have one of the newborn specific seats. It just makes it easier to not have to wake a sleeping baby. However, this is perfect for every stage after! Easy to install. Comfortable. Well made. Easy to clean. Love it!'}, {'header': 'Wow wow wow...the Mercedes of carseats!', 'body': ""My kid just loves this seat! I loves this seat! I can't believe how great it is. It grows with your child from infant, to toddler, and big kid! We are forward facing, and not in the booster stage just yet. Wow! The straps adjust with the headrest! Say what? Yes, you read that right. No more redoing your whole carseat to adjust straps, and fixing the headrest from behind. You can simply lift the headrest, and voila the straps adjust to your child's shoulders perfectly. Okay aside from that, the padding is a plus, removable, washable, and comfy. The carseat can recline back and for forward with a click of a button! Hurray! No more rolling up towels to get the perfect recline for your car! It also has a click mechanism in the carseat that locks the seatbelts into place! How cool is that? Seriously, if you are on the fence about buying a new seat, and have a little one or toddler, or one on the way, think of this one. I know it's not a bucket seat, but it's really that great. Plus I'm most positive it will save you loads of money on ten million other seats (I seriously have like 6 carseats because 2 cars, and 3 kids). Invest in this, and you'll be golden. My daughter also wouldn't stop sitting in it. She loves it!""}, {'header': 'Best carseat', 'body': ""This 3-in-1 car seat is simply the best! Graco has gotten all the bells and whistles on this seat.

Just pull up to raise the belt height, no need to rethread the belt.The cover can be removed for easy cleaning without undoing the belt also!Seat has 2 cup holders that can be removed for cleaning.Belt is tightened by pulling strap in front between child's feet. The is a lever that you push in to easily loosen the belt when it's time to unbuckle.Seat is not heavy to move around or carry if you need to change vehicles.Wonderful seat, totally suggest you buy it.(Baby is still in NICU, so I can't post any pictures of her actually in it)""}, {'header': 'Easy to install!', 'body': ""I will admit it did take me a little while to first install this car seat, however I was trying to do it without reading the instructions first so that was on me. The instructions are very easy to follow and the way the seat is installed gives me great peace of mind that it is secure as possible. I haven't needed to clean it in any way yet so I can't really comment on that part but it does seem like it would be fairly easy to get off the cushions to clean. The only thing that I do not like about it is the fact that when I go to tighten the straps its difficult to pull the strap and really tighten them against my baby. To me feels like it they are a little loose. I think this is due to the fact that the straps are adjustable by moving the back up and down instead of having to thread them thru a different hole. It's a longer feed the straps have to go thru so it makes it more difficult it that makes sense?

I love that it has a lock to go over the seat belt for added protection. installed the seat in about 5 minutes, and it does not budge even an eighth of an inch with the Snug lock engaged. This feature puts my mind to ease as a parent. I truly feel that my son is safe in this car seat. I love that it will grow with him as he gets older. The cushions are very soft and comfortable.

I ended up ordering a fairly inexpensive Graco one to replace it and it was pretty good although very bare bones. I just had twins and while I was expecting I did some research on best car seats for premies (twins tend to be early) and all articles recommended Chicco key fits. I also found these car seats to push babies heads forward. I am so confused why these designs are being made. It visibly looks like it blocks intake of air on a fragile baby. Anyway, after a lot of examining the slope of many car seats (where back to head lies) I decided on this car seat (nico model). It is more than I wanted to spend, especially considering I needed two, but I have to tell you that I’m very very happy with them. My babies look great in them, and I can relax knowing they look very comfortable, safe, and look very well protected in these seats. With my first born I hated going anywhere because I was not happy with my car seats. This experience is very different and I really hope this helps someone who is stressing the way I was years ago. The one con - the car seats were not releasing easily out of the base. For every 5 tries, 3 would work, 2 would get stuck. That was not ok. We contacted Graco and they were wonderful. They sent out 2 replacements car seats ASAP and we mailed them the ones that got stuck. These ones work fine. Very happy with their customer service. When I contacted Britax years back, they did not care, they offered no exchange, no refund, they just said you’re stuck with it. Pretty crazy that you can be forced to keep something SO important to your newborn baby however you can return anything from used makeup to even a vehicle with no hassles.

It really has some amazing safety features and is pretty much a huge, steel-reinforced bubble protecting the baby sitting in this seat. It is BIG though, so if you have a tiny car, please please measure this before purchasing, as it's nearly 30 inches high and weighs over 25 lbs. We have a bigger SUV but I think this might be tough to fit into a smaller car like my old Toyota Corolla. It says it's certified for airline use, but I think I'd not risk using it on a budget airline, so again- check measurements if you intend to travel with it.It's easy to get set up and there's a level there to help you ensure you have it seated properly in the vehicle. I like the zip-off cover that can be washed and the cup holder for older kids.When used rear-facing, it will accommodate a baby up to 40 lbs (and there's actually enough leg room for a kid this big heheheh) and forward-facing, up to 65 lbs. Now I don't know about the forward-facing and a kid 65 lbs or 49 inches high as we have a few kids in the family a little bigger than that and they would definitely not fit in the car seat. Results may vary.This seat is really customizable with a 5-point harness, so as your baby/child grows, you can adjust accordingly. Also, this one has mesh to help your child stay cool. When I compare this to the car seats of my childhood, I don't know how any of us reached adulthood alive. This is a really well-designed seat loaded with features.5 stars!""}, {'header': 'Excellent car seat', 'body': 'Very good quality and easy to use.I gave it to my son for the new grandbaby and he said they love it.'}, {'header': 'Just feels so safe!!!', 'body': 'Where to start?!

Our kiddo is tall and his feet do not dangle so I'm very happy about that. Do note that this car seat is LARGER than others. In a small SUV or sedan it takes up not only seat space but the forward seat cannot be pushed back as much. We are 100% fine with that but pointing that out incase someone didn't anticipate it.Dislikes: The harness belt tension release can easily be pulled down under the seat. Takes a bit to get used to. Wish it came with TWO cup holders. A bit weird that you pay this much $ and only 1 is provided where as other brands provide both with the top model seat.""}]","[{'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UKAVKU9fL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-1.jpg', 'checksum': '4fbb396c997e14115975366565ca54bc', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9175RP4CG9L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-2.jpg', 'checksum': '25d0593286ab40dc422744302bbfeb34', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91WUissebVL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-3.jpg', 'checksum': '092f9cc7dc28e423d64e20487190421f', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91-m9vBpccL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-4.jpg', 'checksum': '73a00d42b7c536a5fc369043fd61e124', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91haGXPWa5L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-5.jpg', 'checksum': '7bab61ec6bd5e202cda70c774e3f138a', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91JZY0mvYqL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-6.jpg', 'checksum': '3473f33195960781cc4afed84a22ccbd', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IKLByf3RL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-7.jpg', 'checksum': '0316c6d7dfb763a23ec27cac4dc26c21', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HtX8DpRvL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-8.jpg', 'checksum': '65684abe0db5bcf40011e3d2e074d5ad', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/912h6LAis+L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-9.jpg', 'checksum': '9b777fa3b4b92becf16c62167d102032', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rpnc6pspL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-10.jpg', 'checksum': 'fa3c65b2a732ea86beaa3059f148b936', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91WUlxJt1yL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-11.jpg', 'checksum': 'cb1e548261282af755c2c77712038879', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91X2COyfgWL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-12.jpg', 'checksum': 'd2211b2637fce9a5cede0de9e6b57879', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eBz0rO4iL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-13.jpg', 'checksum': '4cb128af91602b0c2f296f558877a73b', 'status': 'uptodate'}]",Atmosphere/Black$$$Vero/Black,Car Seat,"B019EGMGR0,B08WJFRQ91,B00K2ZFHAG,B07S27HVLK,B09NKN9ST8,B00J3KL4HG,B079W46W4L,B07XLG6BJH,B07ZWVKR73,B00ISCPJM6,B07BB5VXBW,B01GVJ65MA,B00O9W4704,B07VHVH7YF,B08DTF8VNC,B089MJNSMW,B08Q1LS11S,B081DB6F4D,B08V3CJ85W,B09KTFYKBK,B07YNDK15M,B019EGMGNE,B004CVDQUO,B07QV3118Z,B08VZK14KZ,B00O8RRRSO,B083XVXV7L,B08RFYHMPW,B08SCNB67G,B08SCPHL1Q,B017VNNTX8,B07MC48TNP,B091B58LFD,B07QTYGYLZ,B08YQ4L4Y7,B08586LYYL,B084K44651,B08TX4K5TJ,B09382PVFM,B084K4BXHP,B07NM559VL,B09NPM265Q,B08PDLGG2L,B0938K24VC,B09311PL54,B08PDKM8HJ,B08YQ1NV6N,B0929L3HV6,B08Z2P55HM,B09881YNV8,B08398MV69,B09LKL9NWZ,B09Q7XFCH5,B095L484LJ,B07L4JPQ64,B07T25WNL3,B06XSMY6Y3,B06XG17VNF,B0728GXF8V,B07FQ6M8CR,B07N28BMB5,B08L9K2MHS,B01N6Z70BR,B087H3XJ49,B07ZS4QBVF,B0921CBPG7,B08K2GX7PP,B071VHBYX8,B09YTN79H7,B07R1CPT7Z,B07DGPGQXN,B071L1NG6N,B006PB2B6O,B08C779LF4,B07L47ZRPW,B00PTL2BE8,B07CZT4M2Y,B06VY1DFQN,B00838BNK2,B07CVCHKTT,B07HML1BT5,B07XTWM2XL,B07H8VTTCP,B07XSC4284,B01N3MYMB2,B01N3MYVZM,B01ETUBQZ4,B07XSBT57H,B07J37RTPG,B07KBPKJYT,B07XSBK4Z2,B01MRE9IOC,B0828M8G61,B07YXP3Y2Z,B07HNTTWY8,B07TGX255N,B09RNDW2LH,B01N5P7G80,B07Y5S4VWT,B07MSPMKPQ",,,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WJFRQ91,,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9175RP4CG9L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91WUissebVL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91-m9vBpccL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91haGXPWa5L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91JZY0mvYqL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IKLByf3RL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HtX8DpRvL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/912h6LAis+L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rpnc6pspL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91WUlxJt1yL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91X2COyfgWL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91eBz0rO4iL._SL1500_.jpg",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UKAVKU9fL._SL1500_.jpg

The fabrics are very comparable to our marathons and one4life seats. The button to loosen the harness is hidden under a flap of fabric and the leash to pull to tighten is in its usual spot.I only have these installed rear facing for our 5 month old.In one of our vehicles, I used latch to install (recommended). The weight limit for latch is the same as the rear facing limit of 40lbs. This is different than our other seats which have lower weight limits for latch. The latch install was incredibly easy. Just click and pull to tighten. I was able to very easily get a nice tight install.My husband’s truck does not have latch so I had to use a belt install for this. Following the instructions in the manual, I was able to easily find the rear facing belt path. The lock offs are easy to open, though don’t be like me and only open the top and think the belt goes there. The second be needs to be lifted and then the belt threaded. I was able to get a tight install on the first try but it took a lot of effort to close the belt lock offs.Ultimately, if you have a vehicle with latch, I’d definitely recommend this seat. However if you know you’re going to need a belt install, spend a little extra effort on clicktight since that really makes a good belt install a breeze.'}, {'header': 'THE BEST!!', 'body': ""So, I love britax click tight but this style is actually better!!

I did some research and settled on this one for it's size, price, ease of use, and for being highly recommended brand.I agree with all of the above. The metal bars on the sides make it feel very sturdy. The latch connectors are separate on each side, so it is much easier to get a good quick install when using the latch. I have always heard good things about Britax seats, but they had always been out of my budget. I suppose this is their value chair, but I find it to be very nice still.Cons:. I do not like the rubber pieces that sit on the straps around the chest clip. I assume they are there to help facilitate chest clip placement because so many people put the chest clip in the wrong place, but it makes it inconvenient and is a bit of a pain to adjust when getting baby in and out. I find it easier to place a chest clip on seats without the rubber guide.Overall, if you can get over the weird rubber positioned, this is a good, sturdy, long lasting, easy to adjust, quality car seat with a really cute pattern!""}, {'header': 'Best car seat for the price', 'body': 'Britax never disappoints and this seat is exceptional for the cost!'}, {'header': 'Great Seat, Affordable, Easy to Install.', 'body': ""I love this car seat. It shipped quickly, which was very good as I needed a car seat ASAP. The instructions in the manual were clear and concise. It was super easy for me to install via seat belt in the middle seat of my Nissan Altima, which is not very car seat friendly. I have tried many car seats and none have securely installed in the middle before, so that is a definite plus for me. The seat isn't so heavy that I won't be able to switch it to my stepmom's car when she babysits, and the easy install makes it a quick transition on those days. My son seems comfortable in the seat and doesn't fuss nearly as much as he did in his infant seat from another brand. It isn't too bulky. There's still room for two adults on either side of him, for sure, but I haven't tried out other car seats in this configuration. I know I could put this and another seat on both outboard seats with room for a small adult in the middle, if necessary. I did not have to move either front seat forward to accommodate this car seat, also a plus, and I don't feel I have lost any cargo space in the outboard seats. The harness is easy to adjust, as is the headrest. It was also easy to wipe off the straps with mild soap and water when my son spit up on his first occasion riding in the seat. My only complaint is that Britax doesn't have a seat protector for the car that covers the entire back seat, rather than just under the car seat, but that is definitely not an important issue.""}, {'header': 'Favorite of all my car seats', 'body': ""We've owned a lot of car seats somehow for our 1 child.We've had a Cybex infant seat, 2 Combi Coccoros, 2 Britax Boulevard Clicktights, 1 Nuna Rava and now this.This one is our favorite, even over the Clicktights.We used to use our Coccoro for travel, it was so great. However our daughter finally grew out of it rear facing and we weren't ready to turn her around yet, so we went in search of a seat that would be good for travel and that we could keep her rear facing in until she turned 4.This is such a win. I bought it because I liked that it had a lockoff for installing with the seatbelt. That works great but it's actually so easy to install with latch that we use latch, even at the curbside at the airport. I love that the lower anchors adjust individually, it makes it so easy to install. I also love the way they store, they click into the seat. This actually provides a convenient way to attach it to a suitcase when walking through an airport.It's lighter than the Clicktights so it's easy to move from car to car. The print we got is so cute (purple with polka dots).I thought I might not like that it only had 3 recline levels, and only 1 that could be used rear facing, but it's fine, it fits in my husband's 4 door Tacoma great rear facing.The harness adjuster is so easy to use.Overall, an awesome seat.""}, {'header': 'Good for the price', 'body': 'Do not need anything fancy and this did the trick and is safe.

The Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seat grows with your child from rear-facing harness (4-50 lb) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lb). It features a 4-position extension panel that provides up to 5 of extra rear-facing legroom, allowing your child to safely ride rear-facing longer. Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. With Extend2Fit, the adjustable extension panel and 50 lb rear-facing weight limit allow the seat to grow with your child in rear-facing mode, providing extended rear-facing use. The seat features the No-Rethread Simply Safe Adjust Harness System, which allows you to adjust the height of the headrest and harness in one motion, and InRight LATCH for a one-second LATCH attachment. Harnessing is made easier with fuss-free harness storage pockets that conveniently hold the harness out of the way while you get baby in and out of the car seat. This car seat is Graco ProtectPlus Engineered to help protect in frontal, side, rear, and rollover crashes.

Right off the bat, I disliked that it furthered the (false) notion that kids need more legroom to extended rear face. That aside, it is a home run!First of all, rear facing to 50lbs/49in for $135 is a steal. It\'s hard to find a seat that will even forward face past 50in. (Nautilus 80, Diono, and Britax - if you needed to know.) My 5 year old daughter is 90-100th percentile (47in tall and 48lbs). She could technically rear face in this seat, with a belt install. Probably for the next year. That is something.However, I got this seat for my 2 year old and 8 month old. ""Solar"" said 2-5 weeks for delivery, but the first seat already came about a week later and the next one is shipping now, so it\'s an outside estimate. Plus, to get a $180 seat for $135, I\'d have waited the 5 weeks, anyway. Bargain! (The price and shipping time have changed since my review. That\'s Amazon for you.)As soon as I got it out of the box, I was blown away. One of the things I loved about the competing seat I had my eye on was that it had buckle pockets to keep metal hardware out of the sun and out of the way, but that seat only rear faces to 40lbs/40in and was $180, so I\'d have to spend more just to forward face my 2 year old (33lbs 36in) sooner. So, I was delightfully surprised to get that feature in this seat. (I thought the pockets everyone in the reviews were talking about were for the LATCH clips.)It comes almost fully assembled. You just have to peel the corners of the cover back and pop the cup holders into place. Graco covers are machine-washable anyway, so one might want to take the covers off to pre-wash them, anyway, but the corner gives enough room to insert the cup without removal, if not.The red looks somewhat orange-red in the photo. It isn\'t. It\'s a lighter red than the piping on our other Graco seats, but slightly darker than the photo seems. Definitely not orange/pink.The padding is blow-your-mind soft and silky. The padding in the headrest (red/grey) moves independently from the rest of the headrest (black), for even more positioning options. The removable bum padding is thick, especially for Graco.I was so impressed by the seat, I had to fight the urge to write a review before I installed it.It wasn\'t very heavy/awkward. I carried it to the car to install it and I have little upper body strength or grace. I wish I could say that it was a breeze to install, but it took a little work - but nothing that would shy me away from it.This car seat is best for deep seats. I have a Nissan Pathfinder, full-size SUV. I didn\'t expect issues with space, but I had them. The foot bar makes the car seat stick out, pushing the base off the vehicle seat. The base has a little marker for how far off of the seat it can go and still be safely installed. It also has markers for which of the recline settings are safe for rear facing and ball level.Long story short, I will never be able to safely install this seat with the foot bar fully extended because all of the safe recline settings still leave too much of the base off of the vehicle seat. This isn\'t a deal-breaker for me because I know that my son doesn\'t need any foot bar to rear face, so to get him 1/2 of a foot bar is still cool. He was rear facing in his Contender 65 happily. It\'s just something for people with shallow seats to consider. But again, even with no foot bar, rear facing to 50lbs/49in for $135 is a steal.This is my 3rd child\'s 3rd car seat. My oldest has had 6 and my middle has had 4. They have been installed in countless cars because we rent cars for trips. We have even done three across. I know my way around installing a car seat. This one still took a while to get a tight fit while the latch was connected. Yes, I stood/sat on it and rocked/leaned. The latch even has a handy loop for pulling! I still had to undo it, tighten it, then attach it. No biggie, just took longer. It isn\'t as tight as my son\'s belt install, but it moves less than an inch at the belt path, so it\'s good.The only thing about this seat that made me uneasy was how short the strap is, the one that provides slack for the shoulder straps. Its\'s at least a foot shorter than their other seats have been. Then I realized that we never used all that extra slack in their other seats and this shortening may be a good thing. I even put my 5 year old in it, just to see. She fit, with slack to spare.This may be obvious to most, but this model does not convert to a booster, so you will have to buy a new seat when your child reaches 49in. (The Extend2Fit 3-in-1/All in One does, but this is not that and that is an extra $100-$200 Boosters aren\'t typically $100 [ours was $40 and highly rated/recommended] so it\'s a non-issue.)The forward facing weight limit is 65lbs but most kids will reach 49in long before they hit 65lbs. That is why I didn\'t get one for my 5 year old. Even forward facing, she would need a new seat next year.I have owned over a dozen seats: infant, convertible, booster; Graco, First Years, Maxi cosi, etc.; even seats with apps! This is my favorite, and it isn\'t even the most expensive. In fact, only 3 of our seats have cost less than this one.I can\'t think of much else to say about it, but I\'m happy to answer questions. :)UPDATE: I do see what some parents are talking about, with the chin to chest issue. My kids are bigger, have outgrown infant seats, so they have fine head and neck control. I don\'t know that I would trust an infant in this seat. It\'s still a great seat for babies outgrowing their infant seats. Also, removing the infant headrest insert helps some. I also didn\'t have an issue getting a tight fit that passes the pinch test, but again, I can see how small babies might.NOTE: As far as the negative review about chemicals goes, that study was conducted on 2014 car seats and released in 2015, before this seat was even made. The seat that scored poorly was specifically the MySize 65. A different Graco seat in that same exact study scored better than Peg Perego, Cybex Aton, Orbit, Evenflo, and Baby Trend. The study in no way said all Graco seats were bad, just that the lowest ranked seat happened to be Graco. Also, since those 2014 seats were tested, the use of carcinogens in car seats has dropped, based on more recent tests. Not to mention the fact that ALL car seats have flame retardants, except UPPAbaby. In short, the reviewer cherry-picked outdated data and drew an inaccurate conclusion. The review should be removed.'}, {'header': 'Kept my baby safe and sound asleep during a horrible crash!!', 'body': ""Thanking God for this seat!! My children and I lost control on the highway, did several complete turns, and went down a steep, rocky hill into a ravine.Those first moments were terrifying when the car stopped, and I didn't hear my 1 year old crying like my older child.But there he was, safe and sound, still asleep in his seat. Thankfully he was rear facing.. I can't stomach the thought of his neck if he had been thrown forward like my 11 year old and I.Either way I was always very impressed with this seat. It looks nice. Isn't too huge, and appears to be very comfy. The pads around the head are wonderful too.. for sleeping, and for things you never hope for, like an accident. His head was prevented from being knocked side to side while spinning. I realize I will have to replace this seat now, and when I do I will definitely be ordering another of these.Thank you Graco for keeping my precious cargo safe and snug on the scariest night of my life 🥺""}, {'header': 'Love it', 'body': ""Nicely padded, very secure and easy to install. We just moved up from a newborn car seat which my baby literally NEVER fell asleep in. I was so confused, I thought that was how you got babies to sleep...anyway, we switched to this because he's a big baby and at 6 months, had outgrown his original and the first drive we went on he fell asleep!! Clearly he just hated the original seat and as this one is all fancy and comfy he can just sleep in it! I also love that it can grow with him, so we'll be able to use it for years to come.""}, {'header': 'My favorite car seat!', 'body': ""WOW I love this car seat! We have 3 kids (5, 3, 1) and have owned 11 car seats. This is our first Graco - we’ve owned/own seats from Chicco, Clek, Safety First, Maxi Cosi and Diono. I’ve installed varying combinations of these seats in over 10 cars, including our vehicles, grandparent vehicles and rental cars. This is my favorite car seat and here’s why:- IT’S (comparatively) EASY TO INSTALL. All car seats are a pain to install but this is actually one of the easiest seats I’ve installed. The level is easy to read, so you know you’ll get the angle right. The way they’ve set up the LATCH straps means it’s unlikely you’ll get them twisted. I have no explanation as to why, but I installed it tightly on the first try, which never happens (even with the seats I know really well and have been installing for years).- IT’S COMMON. This is important for anyone that does run into trouble installing: because this seat is so common, it’s easy to find dozens of how-to videos on YouTube that will walk you through the installation and help you troubleshoot any issues.- HIGH REAR-FACING WEIGHT LIMIT. This is probably why most folks buy this seat and it was certainly a selling factor for us. The 50lb rear-facing weight limit means all 3 of my kids can rear face in this seat.- HIGH WEIGHT LIMIT FOR LATCH. This isn’t something I even paid attention to until my kids got older and it’s important! You can use LATCH to install this seat up to 45lbs!!! All of our other seats only allow LATCH up to 30 or 35lbs, which means we have to switch to seat belt installation. It’s not a huge deal but it’s a pain because you have to remember to switch the installation when your child gets over the limit (and actually remember the limit). I prefer LATCH installation so I’m thrilled we get to use LATCH install for almost as long as we can rear-face.- NO RETHREAD HARNESS! This is huge. Kids grow fast and it is a massive pain to uninstall and reinstall car seats when you need to adjust the straps. With this seat, you can just adjust the headrest without removing the entire car seat. I love it!!- IT’S GREAT FOR TALL PARENTS! My husband is 6’5” and all of our rear facing seats have required him to move up his seat when driving... except this one! In one of the photos, you can see the Graco Extend2Fit is installed rear-facing next to Clek Foonf (also rear-facing). The Clek takes up substantially more space front-to-back than the Graco, which surprised me because our Clek takes up less space front-to-back than our other rear-facing car seats. Not only can my husband adjust his seat the way he likes, he’s got leg room to spare!- IT’S AFFORDABLE. Even if it didn’t have all these other great features, it’s one of (if not the most) cost effective car seats for rear-facing to 50lbs. Now that I own one, I think it’s a total steal of a deal!- IT HAS 2 GREAT CUP HOLDERS. I was worried because one of the comments on here claimed that no cups fit in the cup holders. Our child’s water bottle fits just fine. It’s snug but I prefer that because it won’t annoyingly rattle around when we’re driving. I like that there are two cup holders because kiddo can keep toys in the other one.- IT HAS A WASHABLE COVER. Just like installation, all car seat covers are a pain to remove and wash. I think all of our car seats have been thrown up on (usually in the middle of nowhere when we have nothing to clean them up) so I have a lot of experience in this area. Removing the Graco cover is just as easy to remove as other seats. It’s not as easy to remove as the Chicco Zip line but we don’t have to wash the cover so frequently that I feel like I need that feature.- IT HAS A PLACE TO STORE THE BUCKLES. Not all car seats have this and it’s one of my favorite features: there is a nice place to put the buckles so that it’s a little bit easier to buckle kiddo next time because they aren’t sitting in the buckles when they get into the seat. It’s a small thing but I love it.- IT ISN'T OVERLY HEAVY. I can barely lift our Clek because it’s so heavy. The Graco is certainly sturdy but I can still move it.Here is why we didn’t buy it sooner (aka downsides):- IT’S TOO WIDE TO DO 3 ACROSS. Maybe there is a specific configuration that can make this work but we couldn’t. Our Diono and Clek easily allow us to fit 3 kids across the backseat. We got the Graco because we finally bought a minivan and didn’t have to fit 3 kids in the same row. Obviously this isn’t a factor for smaller families or families with larger vehicles.- THE OVERALL APPEARANCE IS MEDIOCRE. It certainly isn’t ugly but many other car seats on the market are more attractive. I also wish the straps weren’t visible on the back.The pros of this seat far outweigh the cons. I absolutely love this seat and I’ve recommended it to everyone that’s asked about it since we’ve purchased it. I’m really impressed by the features.""}, {'header': 'A must have!!', 'body': 'My son love his new car seat!! He is in the 96 percentile for height and weight. He outgrew his infant seat early.

A built in stage-position lever lifts easily to convert the car seat base (included) from Stage 1 to Stage 2 with one motion, creating extended leg room and more upright, spacious seating for growing toddlers. In Stage 1, the Fit2 functions like a traditional rear-facing infant car seat, offering more reclined seating with removable head and body support to accommodate newborns and smaller infants from birth to 12 months. In Stage 2, the Fit2 easily transitions into a rear-facing toddler car seat, offering a more mature seating position for toddlers from 9 to 24 months  without taking up extra space in the vehicle! A 7-position headrest and padded no-rethread harness provide adjustability to accommodate growth throughout both stages. From the makers of the #1-rated KeyFit, the Fit2 is designed with smart functionality that makes it the easiest to install simply, accurately, and securely, every time. The included base features a one-hand-operated ReclineSure leveling foot and two RideRight bubble level-indicators to achieve and verify proper angle in the vehicle seat. Premium LATCH connectors and a force-multiplying SuperCinch tightener help achieve a secure fit with a fraction of the effort! Plus, an integrated stabilizer bar increases surface contact between the base and vehicle seat, providing added support and leverage for a secure install. The base is also designed with easy belt routing and integrated lock-offs for alternate installation with the vehicle seat belt. An enclosed underside helps protect vehicle seats from damage. The Fit2 features easy one-hand adjustment for the carry handle, harness tightener, and headrest. The Fit2 is also designed for travel system use with Chicco strollers, offering extended click-in carrier functionality with a reassuring audible click and one-hand release. Made in Italy with premium Italian fabrics that are both comfortable and sophisticated, the Fit2 has a chic, modern aesthetic for fashion-forward parents. The seat pad is removable, machine-washable, and lined with dual-density foam cushioning for added comfort. The canopy is also adjustable and removable. For improved impact protection, the carrier shell is lined with EPS energy-absorbing foam. For use from 4-35 lbs in Stage 1/Infant Position, from 15-35 lbs in Stage 2/Toddler Position, and up to 35"".

The other upgrade we love is the changing position of the base to grow with the child.

We were looking for something in between, something where he could be more seated but that would not take so much space. This car seat was a great find. In the toddler position, he seats more up-right than in the infant position, so he can see outside and engage with the other kids, and we do not compromise the space in the front of the car. This seat is so very soft, the cover is great because you can use it to cover the Sun when the baby sleeps. Great materials, he really enjoys them.

I also had to go for a season without a car, traveled a lot, and this seat had a great seat belt system to use in Ubers and Lyfts, and clipped into my city select stroller with a generic adapter. The base is super easy to install as well. My son is currently 28 lbs, 32 inches, and 21 months old. I think we will have to start looking for a new seat soon, but I was so grateful to have an infant seat that lasted as long as this one. I will say the only draw back was that it was a bit heavy, but the benefits of this seat outweigh that one drawback. I have rheumatoid arthritis and mobility issues since my son's birth. I walk either with a walking cane out use the stroller to lean on. My hands are also pretty useless because of my disease. But Even I could handle this seat. I feel like if I could manage, almost anyone can.""}, {'header': 'Perfect', 'body': 'Beautiful design, pattern. Easy to install. Feels safe.

From their first ride home, little one will be completely protected in their own personal ""Nest"" of comfort. The Nido features two core elements that offer protections in different ways: 1. The premium base with Load Leg and built-in Anti-Rebound Bar act together to reduce rotation caused by an accident by 50%. The Load Leg can be adjusted up to 10 different positions and is able to be folded under the base when not in use. An Energy Management Foot at the bottom of the Load Leg activates during a crash by crumpling and absorbing energy away from the baby. 2 An extendable Pagoda Hood offers near complete coverage, shielding baby from the elements. There is a mesh side netting for ventilation, keeping airflow circulating. The fabric of the hood is UPF 50+, helping to keep harmful ultraviolet rays away from baby. The Prmo Viaggio 4/35 Nido includes a Dual Stage Cushion System, specifically designed to grow with baby. Stage 1 supports a newborn's neck and bottom. The Stage 2 cushion has been enlarged to provide not only increased protection, but more comfort. The headrest can be adjusted up to six different positions with no re-threading required, even while infant is in the seat.  Peg Perego A worldwide family Previous page We are Peg Perego!

Our daughter has a medical condition and we have to be very careful to not let her get hunched over, like often happens in these infant seats with newborns, as we have to be very careful not to obstruct her airway in any way. When I saw this seat in store with the 2 stage cushion that made the seat lift up more than any I’d ever seen (so her butt doesn’t sink so she bends in half - it’s mkre like a cradled position) we knew it was what we needed, and it’s done exactly that. As the manual says, it keeps her head and neck in proper alignment, and therefore her airway. The base was not difficult at all to install in our Dodge Durango. We have another child in the back so baby was positioned outboard behind the driver. Also because of her medical concern, we have to be very careful about germs. The canopy is amazing for this purpose. If we do take her in public we can close the canopy all the way. It comes right above her feet. I saw a comment about it not closing 100% of the way, I’m not sure why you would want it to do that but it closes more than any other seat I’ve personally ever seen on the market and completely covers baby except for her toes. For our purposes and for the features we got with this seat, it has 100% been worth every penny.

We have been happy with it but I do have a few comments. First of all, the instructions for installing the base were incredibly misleading. It says to tighten and then adjust for baby's weight. This isn't entirely true and it resulted in my husband snapping off the knob and it being stuck on the wrong weight setting. I called customer service and they told me we should have tightened it part way, then adjusted the weight level and then fully tightened it. Nowhere did it explain this in the directions or online anywhere. Luckily they sent replacement parts that were extremely easy to fix. Second, the top doesn't extend down 100%. It's further than most but there's still an area that is uncovered.

I live where it's very hot and sunny and the hood is great--coverage, but breathable. I get compliments on this thing everywhere I go. Plus I really love that it is so safe. (And also seriously, that stitching. Swooooon.)Only downside was the box I received it in was open and taped back together.

I did a ton of research before buying this seat and I am very happy overall.***PROs***- PRICE. While I\'m happy to spend as much as is needed to keep my kiddo safe, my many hours of research have taught me that more money does NOT necessarily mean safer with carseats. This seat has a great safety rating at a price point that allowed us to buy multiples, so we don\'t have to switch it out between cars all the time.- EASY INSTALLATION. We install with seatbelts, so I cannot speak to the latch system on this one. But I can install this one by myself with fairly little effort and if I have a second person, it can be done in about 60 seconds. This is a big bonus for the grandparents, who only have one that they switch between cars.- SIZE. I was worried about putting a bigger seat rearfacing in the back of my Toyota Matrix, but this one doesn\'t really take up any more room front-to-back than the Scenera Next did fully reclined for an infant. We want to stay RF for as long as possible and this seat will let us do just that.- TODDLER APPROVED. My 2.5 year old loves the seat. It\'s comfy without being too hot (a big bonus on the south in July).***CONS***There are really only 2 cons I\'ve found after using this seat for several months.- The straps do tend to twist somewhat easily if you aren\'t careful while buckling.- The button to loosen the straps is kind of hard to get to when the seat is rearfacing in an upright position.All in all, not deal breakers for us.

Keep in mind it can still be used as a booster and last until kid is 80lb. We have been using for a year and it’s great. At $99 that’s a great value. Plus several reviews on here for totaled car accidents and the baby was fine which also puts the mind at ease. You will see most of the 1 star reviews complain about newborns or babies <1, but really those babies would best be suited by an infant car seat as part of a travel system. Safety first infant car seat/stroller ($150) followed by this seat ($99) and you are set for 5-6 years. And safe. Love this brand'}, {'header': 'Very padded for extreme comfort', 'body': 'Grandson He is very comfortable in this well padded car seat'}, {'header': 'Safety 1st - 3 in 1 carseat is worth it!', 'body': 'Love that is not as huge or as simple as other ones, love that it does have leg room and it can tilt back for when my baby falls asleep. I also love that it feels and looks comfortable and from the very beginning my daughter has been enjoying her new carseat. On the side note, the color red & black is very neutral so I can use it if my 2nd baby is a boy no problem.'}, {'header': 'Car seat description should be adjusted because it’s alittle inaccurate', 'body': 'The weight is basically from newborn to a few years old but it really wasn’t adjustable for a newborn when I intended to come home with my baby in it. The fire dept told us not to even take a chance driving home with that car seat. It looks pretty suitable for the ages going up according to size so we plan on still using it later on. Also, the timing for the car seat to have arrived on time wasn’t good. If you’re in a rush, it’s definitely not something to order last minute. You’ll be walking on eggshells wondering when it will come.'}, {'header': 'Best thing EVER!', 'body': ""Having 4 children (3 in some sort of car seat) you could say I'm familiar with these bad boys. This is such a great buy! My husband and I are planning on having another at some point so we wanted a car seat that would grow with our now 7 month old. This fits the bill, without spending $300 on the graco car seat that does the same thing. It's super easy to adjust, no more retreading the straps! You simply turn the top levers and pull up or down to readjust the straps as your child grows. Ahhhh, such a time saver! Time is precious to me. It's super soft and cushiony. Little man loves it! Now, if you have a newborn I'm not sure it would work as well, but I suppose it could. You may need to buy a head support pillow to keep their head in place. The best part for me is the detachable cup holder. Those things get so nasty and hard to clean after a while. This simple little thing is a mothers dream! The belts adjustment is also up higher making loosening and tightening the straps a lot easier when it's in the rear facing position. This is one happy momma!""}, {'header': 'Daughter loves it so I love it', 'body': ""The first carseat I got for my daughter after her infant carrier was the Graco x2f all in one, she's tall so I figured she needed the extended leg room. Well, she hated the seat. She screamed every time I put her in it and she also looked very uncomfortable in it. We got this at first to have an extra in my mother's car, but when we tried her in it she loved it. No more screaming when putting her in the car! She looks very comfortable in it and has no problem being in it. We returned the Graco x2f (all $300 of it) and just kept this one. If we end up getting an extra we will be getting this same seat for sure! Was also very easy to install and does not slide around on my cars seat like the other one did. Yay for Safety 1st. Thanks for making my life a little easier and my baby girl more comfortable. I hope to never have to see how it does in an accident but I'm confident it will be great otherwise I wouldn't be putting my daughter in it.""}, {'header': 'By the version with 4 straps', 'body': 'I bought the same brand for my oldest and made the decision to by this newer version for my youngest. It’s similar, but the rear facing position is a bit wabbley. It has three straps. The first one I bought has 4. It’s more secure.If you have a small car, this also takes up a lot of space. I have a medium cross over and the front seat has to be upright.What I like about this is it has one cup holder. If you place it inwards, you don’t have a hard time getting butts in at all.'}, {'header': 'safe, cute, full of features, and a great price.', 'body': ""Only had a few days, but so far the only thing I would change is the weight limit for the forward facing harness is 50lbs, wish that was higher. It can be converted to a booster, but I'm keeping my girls harnessed as long as I can in this thing. My oldest daughter is 4 and just at 40 lbs so she'll be good through the year hopefully.Installation was normal, I used the anchor and the seat belt since she's right at 40lbs and that's the limit on the latch system. Had my husband put his weight in the car seat, and retract the cars seat-belt and that sucker is not moving at all now. Seems very safe.The colors are bright and beautiful, the cup holder is fantastic! Love how easy it is to adjust the height of the harness and headrest! Even has the nifty strap holders on the side to stick the metal pieces in when they get out. I'm thinking (if I can learn to start doing this) it will be really practical for in the summer and keep those metal pieces a little cooler.""}, {'header': 'Well built but hard to install rear facing.', 'body': 'This car seat seems very sturdy, and I really like it however, my granddaughter is 18 months and is still supposed to be rear facing for best safety. Rear facing gives much less leg room for her and it was very difficult to install in my captain seat of my expedition. In fact I took it to a fire station and had the guys there install it for me. I could not put enough weight on it to cinch the seat belt far enough. I also bought a seat protector which has non slip sections the keep the car seat from sliding in the leather seat. This helped a lot. I think once she is forward facing it will be much easier all around.'}, {'header': 'Highly recommend', 'body': ""I've bought 4 of these over the past 4 years. Pretty easy to install and pretty easy to get kids in and out of. (Considering that car seats and toddlers is just generally my most frustrating daily experience... But I blame the toddler, not the carseat.) Fit 2 in back in a honda accord, toyota prius v3, honda odyssey.""}, {'header': 'Love It', 'body': 'I bought this as a replacement for the Graco Nautalius when my car was stolen. For $100 this convertible car seat is great. I love the way the head rest is positioned, and that it has a good amount of padding. There is a removable cup holder which means you can wash it out (thank god) and my daughter seems to love it more than her previous car seat. It was very easy to install and it is LIGHT WEIGHT. thank goodness, because we transfer car seats often.'}, {'header': 'Great seat!', 'body': ""I have used cheaper car seats in the past and though they work as intended, they can compete with the convenience of this seat. It is easily adjustable and gives you no reason to remove the straps! I can quickly adjust the height of the headrest as my daughter grows without removing it from my car. The cupholder is easily removed so that you can toss it in the dishwasher whenever gunk gets built up in it. My daughter actually lives playing with it as it is made from a soft silicone type material. The seat is nice, roomy, and cushiony. My six year old could use it if needed. I had him test it for me and he could not stop talking about how comfortable it is. I love that my daughter may remain rear facing until she reaches 40 pounds. As the title states, this is a really great seat and I'm glad I spent the extra money for the convenient features.""}, {'header': 'Great fit for baby!', 'body': ""It wasnt time for the baby to get out of the carrier but she was too heavy to keep rotting around. I bought this just in time for the growth spurt. Idk if it's the seat or the driving but she's fast asleep in 10 minutes and the seat stays secure through every bump. If installed correctly you will not have any issues. Read the manual. I definitely foresee using this for the next 2 years. Beautiful colors easy to clean as well""}, {'header': '👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻', 'body': 'Very good car seat I recommend this better than one that is more wider it works great for forward Facing and rear facing and it convert to a seat belt booster so that a plus until they grow out of it and need a regular booster but it very nice and for that price this is my second one I have'}, {'header': 'Comfortable/easy to get child in and out', 'body': ""This car seat was bought for my second child. So I have a little experience with what I've liked and disliked in other carseats too. This one is great with the built in cupholder. Plus the extra padding around the head is nice, it allows my daughter to sleep against it and her head not to bob so much. The harness is easy to adjust. The seat itself seems very comfortable and padded.My daughter is currently 15 months old and we have it rear facing, so I can't comment on how good it will be forward facing yet.""}, {'header': 'I love this carseat', 'body': 'I love this car seat.

Bought it right then and there. And I LOVE it. Obviously the 4ever is amazing, but I definitely couldn't afford another one of those. So this met every single one of my needs!

Some of the reviews a read state that there is a lot of movement in the car seat when rear facing. I did not experience that at all. The car seat is very secure and my baby fits very comfortably.

It\'s life utility is truly remarkable: An Entire Decade, and rated by both the NTSB and Insurance Industry as one of the top Five now available. I\'m a eternal bachelor, but having been in International and Domestic Logistics, my research of these types of units is based on the following: reports by the NTSB, Insurance Industry Analysis, and various customer based sources: this unit exceeds my expectations. This for a future ""Great Nephew,"" with a due date in Jan. 2019, so had to do some careful and detailed research prior to purchasing. I also note that some hospitals have trained and experienced technicians who will install the thing for a nominal fee, and also instructions can be found on the Internet-Youtube.com. Just remember that infants face rearward towards the seat and later can be turned around. In summary, it is well worth the purchase price (which is commensurately high), but with safety and utility it will give years of service and not need a booster seat when the child gets bigger. On any such units, I recommend that a full cotton bath towel or two be placed between the infant car seat and the car seat itself to preclude or reduce abrasion on the car seating material. With all factors considered, with Child Safety First- it is worthy of the highest considerations to purchase.'}, {'header': 'Thank you', 'body': 'I like very much.

After spending two months reading the safety info doing a cost versus benefit analysis and understanding booster seats and their cost, etc I dove into our savings and bought two MAXI COSI Magellans. My husband said that I should keep one and he get a cheaper one, I insisted that our childs safety and comfort is not something we can skimp on. We used the car belts to go through the loops and the car seat still moved like crazy. UNSECURE and UNSAFE!! I pulled the anchor belts from the car seat itself and got much better results only to realize that we were lucky that our son wasn't injured in the insufficient graco seat during my husbands car accident in October when a truck hit them and pushed them out of the lane.

Our favorite was always the Chicco but the Maxi Cosi comes pretty close. It's very easy to install -- one downside is that they hide the LATCH clips perhaps for older kids who use the seat belt with it so it's a bit of a pain to get out but it's a one time issue. Once it's installed, it's very snug, doesn't move around at all (we're using it front facing since our son is 2.5 years). My biggest pet peeve with most car seats is the ease of clipping the seat buckles and tightening the straps but this one is VERY easy to do and you can get a really snug fit for your kid. My son has been very comfortable in the seat -- we've had no complaints. The biggest benefit of this car seat is that you can use it starting at a really young age and it goes till 10 years. We got it when my son was a toddler but hope to use it for years to come. Also, if this is helpful, we use it in a minivan and have two car seats in our middle row -- I don't find it too bulky at all.""}, {'header': 'Amazing', 'body': 'I bought this car seat on amazon deal days because it seemed like a good deal, i was really wanting a graco 4ever seat because my older son is already in one of those and seems to like it and it’s pretty easy to operate plus i didn’t want one to think the others seat is better. Well they weren’t on sale and i thought well I’ll give this seat a try. SO HAPPY that i did i now wish my other son had this seat too! My son that’s in the maxi cosi would cry every time we would get in the car it was painful but he never cries now he loves his new seat and it makes our life better too!

Oh my she’s 5 months now and I tell you it’s night and day, she is so calm in her car seat. Now she will be looking out the window and just calmly fall asleep. I love my Magellan.

I would say I LOVE this product for my 2 year old, however my 5 year old daughter found it to be an awkward position for herself when I made her try it out and she's only slightly above average for height.

This is by far my FAVORITE ONE!! It got great ratings on all of the safety websites, so I figured, for the lower-end price range, I'd give it a shot! It is the BEST! It is very well cushioned and comfortable for my one-year-old, and you can tell it is very well constructed. The cushions and lining all come off to be washed (a total plus for moms with messy boys!). The knobs that tighten the straps are awesome. No more breaking my nails trying to reach between the seat and the car seat (when the car seat is rear facing) to try to tighten the straps. Just a couple clicks of the knob, and it's done! Also, adjusting the height of the straps couldn't be easier! No more taking the seat apart to move them up through the slits, inevitably having to do it multiple times because they got twisted or accidentally went through the wrong slits... Just hold the tabs and pull up! This seat is genius. I wish I'd had it with my oldest! He had a Britax Marathon, and it fell apart within a year. ugh. The high price tag was NOT worth it on that seat! I've had this one over a month, and I can already tell it's going to last better than the Britax.

It can be hard to transport this seat from car to car for sure. It is a very good seat though, the heaviness of the seat makes me feel more confident that it will keep my baby safe in any accident. It has good side panels and it is easy to buckle baby in. I have an SUV so this seat fits fine in my car but it would be pretty tight for a small car.

Only real thing I dislike is I will be needing to buy another car seat once baby hits 39 pounds. Other than that it’s a great buy and I highly recommend'}, {'header': 'Excellent stroller for my new grandchild.', 'body': 'We chose this stroller for the ease of closing the stroller and the adjustability of the height of the pushing handle.

The Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seat grows with your child from rear-facing harness (4-50 lbs) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lbs). It features a 4-position extension panel that provides up to 5 of extra rear-facing legroom, allowing your child to safely ride rear-facing longer. Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. With Extend2Fit, the adjustable extension panel and 50 lbs rear-facing weight limit allow the seat to grow with your child in rear-facing mode, providing extended rear-facing use. The seat features the No-Rethread Simply Safe Adjust Harness System, which allows you to adjust the height of the headrest and harness in one motion, and InRight LATCH for a one-second LATCH attachment. Harnessing is made easier with fuss-free harness storage pockets that conveniently hold the harness out of the way while you get baby in and out of the car seat. This car seat is Graco ProtectPlus Engineered to help protect in frontal, side, rear, and rollover crashes.

Right off the bat, I disliked that it furthered the (false) notion that kids need more legroom to extended rear face. That aside, it is a home run!First of all, rear facing to 50lbs/49in for $135 is a steal. It\'s hard to find a seat that will even forward face past 50in. (Nautilus 80, Diono, and Britax - if you needed to know.) My 5 year old daughter is 90-100th percentile (47in tall and 48lbs). She could technically rear face in this seat, with a belt install. Probably for the next year. That is something.However, I got this seat for my 2 year old and 8 month old. ""Solar"" said 2-5 weeks for delivery, but the first seat already came about a week later and the next one is shipping now, so it\'s an outside estimate. Plus, to get a $180 seat for $135, I\'d have waited the 5 weeks, anyway. Bargain! (The price and shipping time have changed since my review. That\'s Amazon for you.)As soon as I got it out of the box, I was blown away. One of the things I loved about the competing seat I had my eye on was that it had buckle pockets to keep metal hardware out of the sun and out of the way, but that seat only rear faces to 40lbs/40in and was $180, so I\'d have to spend more just to forward face my 2 year old (33lbs 36in) sooner. So, I was delightfully surprised to get that feature in this seat. (I thought the pockets everyone in the reviews were talking about were for the LATCH clips.)It comes almost fully assembled. You just have to peel the corners of the cover back and pop the cup holders into place. Graco covers are machine-washable anyway, so one might want to take the covers off to pre-wash them, anyway, but the corner gives enough room to insert the cup without removal, if not.The red looks somewhat orange-red in the photo. It isn\'t. It\'s a lighter red than the piping on our other Graco seats, but slightly darker than the photo seems. Definitely not orange/pink.The padding is blow-your-mind soft and silky. The padding in the headrest (red/grey) moves independently from the rest of the headrest (black), for even more positioning options. The removable bum padding is thick, especially for Graco.I was so impressed by the seat, I had to fight the urge to write a review before I installed it.It wasn\'t very heavy/awkward. I carried it to the car to install it and I have little upper body strength or grace. I wish I could say that it was a breeze to install, but it took a little work - but nothing that would shy me away from it.This car seat is best for deep seats. I have a Nissan Pathfinder, full-size SUV. I didn\'t expect issues with space, but I had them. The foot bar makes the car seat stick out, pushing the base off the vehicle seat. The base has a little marker for how far off of the seat it can go and still be safely installed. It also has markers for which of the recline settings are safe for rear facing and ball level.Long story short, I will never be able to safely install this seat with the foot bar fully extended because all of the safe recline settings still leave too much of the base off of the vehicle seat. This isn\'t a deal-breaker for me because I know that my son doesn\'t need any foot bar to rear face, so to get him 1/2 of a foot bar is still cool. He was rear facing in his Contender 65 happily. It\'s just something for people with shallow seats to consider. But again, even with no foot bar, rear facing to 50lbs/49in for $135 is a steal.This is my 3rd child\'s 3rd car seat. My oldest has had 6 and my middle has had 4. They have been installed in countless cars because we rent cars for trips. We have even done three across. I know my way around installing a car seat. This one still took a while to get a tight fit while the latch was connected. Yes, I stood/sat on it and rocked/leaned. The latch even has a handy loop for pulling! I still had to undo it, tighten it, then attach it. No biggie, just took longer. It isn\'t as tight as my son\'s belt install, but it moves less than an inch at the belt path, so it\'s good.The only thing about this seat that made me uneasy was how short the strap is, the one that provides slack for the shoulder straps. Its\'s at least a foot shorter than their other seats have been. Then I realized that we never used all that extra slack in their other seats and this shortening may be a good thing. I even put my 5 year old in it, just to see. She fit, with slack to spare.This may be obvious to most, but this model does not convert to a booster, so you will have to buy a new seat when your child reaches 49in. (The Extend2Fit 3-in-1/All in One does, but this is not that and that is an extra $100-$200 Boosters aren\'t typically $100 [ours was $40 and highly rated/recommended] so it\'s a non-issue.)The forward facing weight limit is 65lbs but most kids will reach 49in long before they hit 65lbs. That is why I didn\'t get one for my 5 year old. Even forward facing, she would need a new seat next year.I have owned over a dozen seats: infant, convertible, booster; Graco, First Years, Maxi cosi, etc.; even seats with apps! This is my favorite, and it isn\'t even the most expensive. In fact, only 3 of our seats have cost less than this one.I can\'t think of much else to say about it, but I\'m happy to answer questions. :)UPDATE: I do see what some parents are talking about, with the chin to chest issue. My kids are bigger, have outgrown infant seats, so they have fine head and neck control. I don\'t know that I would trust an infant in this seat. It\'s still a great seat for babies outgrowing their infant seats. Also, removing the infant headrest insert helps some. I also didn\'t have an issue getting a tight fit that passes the pinch test, but again, I can see how small babies might.NOTE: As far as the negative review about chemicals goes, that study was conducted on 2014 car seats and released in 2015, before this seat was even made. The seat that scored poorly was specifically the MySize 65. A different Graco seat in that same exact study scored better than Peg Perego, Cybex Aton, Orbit, Evenflo, and Baby Trend. The study in no way said all Graco seats were bad, just that the lowest ranked seat happened to be Graco. Also, since those 2014 seats were tested, the use of carcinogens in car seats has dropped, based on more recent tests. Not to mention the fact that ALL car seats have flame retardants, except UPPAbaby. In short, the reviewer cherry-picked outdated data and drew an inaccurate conclusion. The review should be removed.'}, {'header': 'Kept my baby safe and sound asleep during a horrible crash!!', 'body': ""Thanking God for this seat!! My children and I lost control on the highway, did several complete turns, and went down a steep, rocky hill into a ravine.Those first moments were terrifying when the car stopped, and I didn't hear my 1 year old crying like my older child.But there he was, safe and sound, still asleep in his seat. Thankfully he was rear facing.. I can't stomach the thought of his neck if he had been thrown forward like my 11 year old and I.Either way I was always very impressed with this seat. It looks nice. Isn't too huge, and appears to be very comfy. The pads around the head are wonderful too.. for sleeping, and for things you never hope for, like an accident. His head was prevented from being knocked side to side while spinning. I realize I will have to replace this seat now, and when I do I will definitely be ordering another of these.Thank you Graco for keeping my precious cargo safe and snug on the scariest night of my life 🥺""}, {'header': 'Love it', 'body': ""Nicely padded, very secure and easy to install. We just moved up from a newborn car seat which my baby literally NEVER fell asleep in. I was so confused, I thought that was how you got babies to sleep...anyway, we switched to this because he's a big baby and at 6 months, had outgrown his original and the first drive we went on he fell asleep!! Clearly he just hated the original seat and as this one is all fancy and comfy he can just sleep in it! I also love that it can grow with him, so we'll be able to use it for years to come.""}, {'header': 'My favorite car seat!', 'body': ""WOW I love this car seat! We have 3 kids (5, 3, 1) and have owned 11 car seats. This is our first Graco - we’ve owned/own seats from Chicco, Clek, Safety First, Maxi Cosi and Diono. I’ve installed varying combinations of these seats in over 10 cars, including our vehicles, grandparent vehicles and rental cars. This is my favorite car seat and here’s why:- IT’S (comparatively) EASY TO INSTALL. All car seats are a pain to install but this is actually one of the easiest seats I’ve installed. The level is easy to read, so you know you’ll get the angle right. The way they’ve set up the LATCH straps means it’s unlikely you’ll get them twisted. I have no explanation as to why, but I installed it tightly on the first try, which never happens (even with the seats I know really well and have been installing for years).- IT’S COMMON. This is important for anyone that does run into trouble installing: because this seat is so common, it’s easy to find dozens of how-to videos on YouTube that will walk you through the installation and help you troubleshoot any issues.- HIGH REAR-FACING WEIGHT LIMIT. This is probably why most folks buy this seat and it was certainly a selling factor for us. The 50lb rear-facing weight limit means all 3 of my kids can rear face in this seat.- HIGH WEIGHT LIMIT FOR LATCH. This isn’t something I even paid attention to until my kids got older and it’s important! You can use LATCH to install this seat up to 45lbs!!! All of our other seats only allow LATCH up to 30 or 35lbs, which means we have to switch to seat belt installation. It’s not a huge deal but it’s a pain because you have to remember to switch the installation when your child gets over the limit (and actually remember the limit). I prefer LATCH installation so I’m thrilled we get to use LATCH install for almost as long as we can rear-face.- NO RETHREAD HARNESS! This is huge. Kids grow fast and it is a massive pain to uninstall and reinstall car seats when you need to adjust the straps. With this seat, you can just adjust the headrest without removing the entire car seat. I love it!!- IT’S GREAT FOR TALL PARENTS! My husband is 6’5” and all of our rear facing seats have required him to move up his seat when driving... except this one! In one of the photos, you can see the Graco Extend2Fit is installed rear-facing next to Clek Foonf (also rear-facing). The Clek takes up substantially more space front-to-back than the Graco, which surprised me because our Clek takes up less space front-to-back than our other rear-facing car seats. Not only can my husband adjust his seat the way he likes, he’s got leg room to spare!- IT’S AFFORDABLE. Even if it didn’t have all these other great features, it’s one of (if not the most) cost effective car seats for rear-facing to 50lbs. Now that I own one, I think it’s a total steal of a deal!- IT HAS 2 GREAT CUP HOLDERS. I was worried because one of the comments on here claimed that no cups fit in the cup holders. Our child’s water bottle fits just fine. It’s snug but I prefer that because it won’t annoyingly rattle around when we’re driving. I like that there are two cup holders because kiddo can keep toys in the other one.- IT HAS A WASHABLE COVER. Just like installation, all car seat covers are a pain to remove and wash. I think all of our car seats have been thrown up on (usually in the middle of nowhere when we have nothing to clean them up) so I have a lot of experience in this area. Removing the Graco cover is just as easy to remove as other seats. It’s not as easy to remove as the Chicco Zip line but we don’t have to wash the cover so frequently that I feel like I need that feature.- IT HAS A PLACE TO STORE THE BUCKLES. Not all car seats have this and it’s one of my favorite features: there is a nice place to put the buckles so that it’s a little bit easier to buckle kiddo next time because they aren’t sitting in the buckles when they get into the seat. It’s a small thing but I love it.- IT ISN'T OVERLY HEAVY. I can barely lift our Clek because it’s so heavy. The Graco is certainly sturdy but I can still move it.Here is why we didn’t buy it sooner (aka downsides):- IT’S TOO WIDE TO DO 3 ACROSS. Maybe there is a specific configuration that can make this work but we couldn’t. Our Diono and Clek easily allow us to fit 3 kids across the backseat. We got the Graco because we finally bought a minivan and didn’t have to fit 3 kids in the same row. Obviously this isn’t a factor for smaller families or families with larger vehicles.- THE OVERALL APPEARANCE IS MEDIOCRE. It certainly isn’t ugly but many other car seats on the market are more attractive. I also wish the straps weren’t visible on the back.The pros of this seat far outweigh the cons. I absolutely love this seat and I’ve recommended it to everyone that’s asked about it since we’ve purchased it. I’m really impressed by the features.""}, {'header': 'A must have!!', 'body': 'My son love his new car seat!! He is in the 96 percentile for height and weight. He outgrew his infant seat early.

It really has some amazing safety features and is pretty much a huge, steel-reinforced bubble protecting the baby sitting in this seat. It is BIG though, so if you have a tiny car, please please measure this before purchasing, as it's nearly 30 inches high and weighs over 25 lbs. We have a bigger SUV but I think this might be tough to fit into a smaller car like my old Toyota Corolla. It says it's certified for airline use, but I think I'd not risk using it on a budget airline, so again- check measurements if you intend to travel with it.It's easy to get set up and there's a level there to help you ensure you have it seated properly in the vehicle. I like the zip-off cover that can be washed and the cup holder for older kids.When used rear-facing, it will accommodate a baby up to 40 lbs (and there's actually enough leg room for a kid this big heheheh) and forward-facing, up to 65 lbs. Now I don't know about the forward-facing and a kid 65 lbs or 49 inches high as we have a few kids in the family a little bigger than that and they would definitely not fit in the car seat. Results may vary.This seat is really customizable with a 5-point harness, so as your baby/child grows, you can adjust accordingly. Also, this one has mesh to help your child stay cool. When I compare this to the car seats of my childhood, I don't know how any of us reached adulthood alive. This is a really well-designed seat loaded with features.5 stars!""}, {'header': 'Excellent car seat', 'body': 'Very good quality and easy to use.I gave it to my son for the new grandbaby and he said they love it.'}, {'header': 'Just feels so safe!!!', 'body': 'Where to start?!

Was so easy to install so it just feels safe and snug! No guessing if it’s in right like with all the others. Simple and easy to install, with just the right amount of luxury the my sweet girl! Great purchase! Chicco never disappoints!'}, {'header': 'Great so far my 15mo fits in it perfectly.', 'body': 'If your middle seat has a shoulder strap you cant pull it thru'}, {'header': ""Confident in Child's Safety"", 'body': ""Likes: it's the safest car seat in its class on consumer reports and the seat functionally represents that. Our kiddo is tall and his feet do not dangle so I'm very happy about that. Do note that this car seat is LARGER than others. In a small SUV or sedan it takes up not only seat space but the forward seat cannot be pushed back as much. We are 100% fine with that but pointing that out incase someone didn't anticipate it.Dislikes: The harness belt tension release can easily be pulled down under the seat. Takes a bit to get used to. Wish it came with TWO cup holders. A bit weird that you pay this much $ and only 1 is provided where as other brands provide both with the top model seat.""}]","[{'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IbS3+Lw1L._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-1.jpg', 'checksum': '4fbb396c997e14115975366565ca54bc', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9175RP4CG9L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-2.jpg', 'checksum': '25d0593286ab40dc422744302bbfeb34', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91WUissebVL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-3.jpg', 'checksum': '092f9cc7dc28e423d64e20487190421f', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91-m9vBpccL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-4.jpg', 'checksum': '73a00d42b7c536a5fc369043fd61e124', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91haGXPWa5L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-5.jpg', 'checksum': '7bab61ec6bd5e202cda70c774e3f138a', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91JZY0mvYqL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-6.jpg', 'checksum': '3473f33195960781cc4afed84a22ccbd', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IKLByf3RL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-7.jpg', 'checksum': '0316c6d7dfb763a23ec27cac4dc26c21', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HtX8DpRvL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-8.jpg', 'checksum': '65684abe0db5bcf40011e3d2e074d5ad', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/912h6LAis+L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-9.jpg', 'checksum': '9b777fa3b4b92becf16c62167d102032', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wiiriZBeL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-10.jpg', 'checksum': 'fa3c65b2a732ea86beaa3059f148b936', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/917CC5ZILqL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-11.jpg', 'checksum': 'cb1e548261282af755c2c77712038879', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8158F326pnL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-12.jpg', 'checksum': 'd2211b2637fce9a5cede0de9e6b57879', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91CHWcrtPVL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-NextFit-Max-Convertible-Seat-13.jpg', 'checksum': '4cb128af91602b0c2f296f558877a73b', 'status': 'uptodate'}]",Atmosphere/Black$$$Vero/Black,Car Seat,"B019EGMGR0,B08WJFRQ91,B00K2ZFHAG,B07S27HVLK,B09NKN9ST8,B00J3KL4HG,B079W46W4L,B07XLG6BJH,B07ZWVKR73,B00ISCPJM6,B07BB5VXBW,B01GVJ65MA,B00O9W4704,B07VHVH7YF,B08DTF8VNC,B089MJNSMW,B08Q1LS11S,B081DB6F4D,B08V3CJ85W,B09KTFYKBK,B07YNDK15M,B019EGMGNE,B004CVDQUO,B07QV3118Z,B08VZK14KZ,B00O8RRRSO,B083XVXV7L,B08RFYHMPW,B08SCNB67G,B08SCPHL1Q,B017VNNTX8,B07MC48TNP,B091B58LFD,B07QTYGYLZ,B08YQ4L4Y7,B08586LYYL,B084K44651,B08TX4K5TJ,B09382PVFM,B084K4BXHP,B07NM559VL,B09NPM265Q,B08PDLGG2L,B0938K24VC,B09311PL54,B08PDKM8HJ,B08YQ1NV6N,B0929L3HV6,B08Z2P55HM,B09881YNV8,B08398MV69,B09LKL9NWZ,B09Q7XFCH5,B095L484LJ,B07L4JPQ64,B07T25WNL3,B06XSMY6Y3,B06XG17VNF,B0728GXF8V,B07FQ6M8CR,B07N28BMB5,B08L9K2MHS,B01N6Z70BR,B087H3XJ49,B07ZS4QBVF,B0921CBPG7,B08K2GX7PP,B071VHBYX8,B09YTN79H7,B07R1CPT7Z,B07DGPGQXN,B071L1NG6N,B006PB2B6O,B08C779LF4,B07L47ZRPW,B00PTL2BE8,B07CZT4M2Y,B06VY1DFQN,B00838BNK2,B07CVCHKTT,B07HML1BT5,B07XTWM2XL,B07H8VTTCP,B07XSC4284,B01N3MYMB2,B01N3MYVZM,B01ETUBQZ4,B07XSBT57H,B07J37RTPG,B07KBPKJYT,B07XSBK4Z2,B01MRE9IOC,B0828M8G61,B07YXP3Y2Z,B07HNTTWY8,B07TGX255N,B09RNDW2LH,B01N5P7G80,B07Y5S4VWT,B07MSPMKPQ",,,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091B58LFD,,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9175RP4CG9L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91WUissebVL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91-m9vBpccL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91haGXPWa5L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91JZY0mvYqL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IKLByf3RL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HtX8DpRvL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/912h6LAis+L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wiiriZBeL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/917CC5ZILqL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8158F326pnL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91CHWcrtPVL._SL1500_.jpg",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IbS3+Lw1L._SL1000_.jpg

The adjustable harness is so simple, just pull the harness up for taller kids. The back of the seat has a lever lock on the back to make higher and a pull handle on the bottom front to tilt the seat back for nap time. It came assembled and all that needed done was to hook it in at 3 points (top behind headrest, and bottom hooks near seatbelts) and slide the seatbelt between the seat and cover and hook it in.

It has an anti-rebound bar which is required in Europe and Canada, buy not yet in the US (to my knowledge) however as these regulations end up being standardised across countries eventually, I'm sure it will be soon. That is my only comment on safety, every seat for sale in the US has passed the US standards and therefore differentiating on safety isn't really helpful (with the exception of the anti-rebound bar), therefore it comes down to style and budget. For me, it was styleMost seats on the market look like they're just pillows stuffed into a bucket, and then there are the fabrics. Well, the less I say about a car seat that looks like it was made using my Grandmothers curtains the better. This one however, just looks so much better designed and finished. So I was sold. It has a nice form, all the straps are hidden under the cover at the rear (and quickly adjustable - no re-threading), the fabrics are tasteful (mostly), and the stitching reminds me of an Italian sports car.Then it arrived. What isn't shown well in the photos is that to be sold in the US, everything must be liberally coated in Warning stickers. *Warning! The earth will cease rotating and day will turn to night - if you don't ensure the straps are snug*. *Warning! A plague of locusts will eat every living thing (including your children) - If you leave your Child unattended*. *Warning! A massive solar flare will reduce the earth to a barren wasteland - if you place the carrier on a counter top, or any elevated surface*. Seriously, the stickers are that ridiculous. It has an instruction manual, but you have to wonder why when the entire contents of the manual is stuck all over the damn seat.However it would appear that our Italian friends were equally as incensed that they would have to deface their tasteful piece of Italian design with warning stickers just so it can be sold on the American market. Most of the stickers on mine were poorly attached, they hadn't been pressed on very firmly at all. I can just imagine poor Giuseppe, tasked with the job of applying the *Warning! Your Childs head will fall off and roll around on the floor creating a tripping hazard - if it is not a minimum of 1 inch from the top of the headrest* sticker, and just half-heartedly slapped it on, perhaps hoping it'd just fall off eventually (the sticker, not the head).So I spent 10 minutes peeling all these damn stickers off, including the ones that point to the storage port for the attachment straps..... which is fairly obvious even to my dog, as there was an attachment strap stored in there. The same stickers also pointed out the port where the strap should be routed and was coloured a nice blue colour on the sticker. Once again superfluous as the strap was already installed in there, there was nowhere else for the strap to go, and the port is made out of blue plastic anyway. My dog may have had more trouble with that one, but as the strap was already installed in there it really wouldn't have been a safety issue even If I had asked him to install it in the car for me.Now my seat looks like it was designed to look. I am slightly annoyed that they decided to screen-print warning labels to the fabric on either side of the Childs head though. If they were stitched on, I could have simply un-picked them. This may have created a gravitational anomaly that would pull Mars onto Earth's orbit causing planetary collisions that would wipe out all life in the solar system for all eternity - but that is a risk I was prepared to take. Sadly I won't be able to take that risk as the powers that be clearly think that having my Childs head permanently flanked by two large Warning Labels that I will never read is of more importance than something as silly as aesthetics.When I buy a motorcycle helmet it doesn't have warning stickers on it. Where's the *Warning! Insert head here* sticker? Or the *Warning! Insert head with visor facing forward* sticker? Surely riding a motorcycle with your helmet on backwards would be a greater risk than having my baby's car seat out of arms reach (and yes, there is a warning sticker for that).So apart from having some Health and Safety numpty ruining it with stickers, this is definitely a five star seat. Like anything the straps take a little practice, but there are elastic loops to hold the straps either side of the seat so you don't have to dig around under your child looking for them. I practiced with a teddy bear as he was less likely to complain as I stuffed him in and tugged on the tightening strap until he was compressed to half his size. And being 4-35lbs, you'll get to use the seat for longer (most on the market are only rated to 30lbs) so you'll get your money's worth out of it. Installation is a breeze, although the manual was clearly also designed for the American legal system. Every other sentence ended with the disclaimer `refer to you vehicle handbook' for anything more complex than opening a door.There are a couple of videos on YouTube which helped me purchase sight unseen. Do a search and you'll see how everything works, and how it looks. It's very stylish. And although they claim it's lighter than previous model my wife can't carry it, so it is important that it match my Italian loafers as I'm the one lugging this thing around.""}, {'header': 'Comfortable & efficient once you learn how to use', 'body': 'I’m a first time mom & I have twins so I was expecting heavy car seats but these are super light weight for how durable they are.Being a first time mom, I didn’t have any prior knowledge of how to loosen the seat belt.

The safety ratings are fantastic from third party sites, which was a top priority for us. Additionally our baby loves it. It breathes well unlike other car seats and has a lot of options for cushions to be able to adjust for the weight and height of your child. Additionally the straps have a super easy adjustment that you just snap into place on the back so you don’t have to rethread the straps every time your baby grows. Bonus is that it is very stylish. We constantly get compliments and have people ask what brand. It’s also narrow enough that we can fit three across if we need to. Clips easily into and out of the base and onto and off our stroller (we have the City Select with the car seat adapter). It’s also really easy to use without the base and uses the handle as a rebound bar with or without the base. (Look that up, it’s really important if you get into a crash.) We’d buy it again, but we won’t have to because it’s also got a longer expiration period so we can use it for more than one kid safely.(Note that Amazon is selling some car seats that are a year or more old already so that can cut into the longevity of the car seat, but that’s not the manufacturer’s fault, that’s bad service from Amazon.)'}, {'header': 'Love it!', 'body': 'This is a beautiful car seat with ample cushions to keep my newborn safe and snug. Very easy to use because you can easily click it right into the car seat base and easily remove it with a lever located on the back of the seat. We ended up purchasing another base for my husband’s car for the convenience of clicking the car seat in either of our cars. The seat itself is pretty heavy for someone like me that doesn’t have much upper body strength. My baby is about 10lbs and with her in the car seat it feels like your holding 30 or so pounds with one arm. Luckily we bought car seat adapters for our Bugaboo stroller so we can just click and go. The other issue is that the car seat is pretty large and takes up quite a bit of room in the back seat of our small SUV. We have to move the front seat really close to the dashboard in order for the car seat to fit. So, I always end up sitting in the back with the baby while my husband drives because I cannot fit or be comfortable in the front passenger seat.'}, {'header': 'Much lighter than previous version!', 'body': ""I purchased this car seat through Amazon warehouse as a return and could not be happier with my purchase!

This happens with plenty seats though and the fix is super easy. We just put a pool noodle under the base on the end where the seat belt lock is. Even with needing the pool noodle, it's still a quick and painless install.Unlike the previous version of the seat, this seat is super light in weight.

The stroller is so easy to push and fold and unfold. I can do it really in just a few seconds. The infant seat fits in and latches nicely-- it isn't simple to get disconnected, but you wouldn't want it to accidentally disconnect anyways and, I suspect, it will get easier with more practice.I love that the two pieces go together and came together. The lining of both the stroller and car seat are easily removeable to wash and fasten back on easily, too. The baby seat isn't the kind that grows with your baby-- it's an infant seat, so you will nead to get the older baby seat later. But, for the babies 35 pounds and under, this is a fantastic seat. And, while they're very small, using the seat in the stroller is excellent. As soon as you want to keep them in the stroller alone, without the additional seat, it will be a lot easier than transfering the seat back and forth.The wheels of the stroller move smoothly--- I like how they maneuver even over bumps. I'm not sure what the benefit is of having the three sets of wheels as opposed to four-- when they are small wheels like this. It does fold a little differently, I'm not sure that's an actual benefit, though. With my other kids, I had two strollers that broke their wheels DUriNG use. Having three remaining working wheels at least made it possible to wheel the thing to my destination. If a wheel set broke while in use here, the thing would be completely unusable-- even during short distances. That said, this one comes in a set, so I still recommend it, but I'm paranoid about wheels now and would check them all prior to every use.Very comfortable and attractive stroller. Lightweight, easy to use, nice amount of storage, nice canopy. I'm very happy with the infant seat, as well, though we have a better infant seat in the other car. Still, this one is usable with this stroller, and I really like that.Recommended.""}, {'header': 'Travel is the operative term here!', 'body': 'Travel is the operative term here!

It’s one thing if your car seat never comes out of the car, but for parents that or may be using cabs, or if you’re having mom or dad take the baby for the day and they need a car seat carrying these car seats around can be outright exhausting! This is the lightest car seat I’ve ever used! And yet it remains constant to the safety standards needed for these units. It was easy to hook up to my jeep, and easy to undo as well. It’s an infant car seat, so this is not a car seat that your child will grow into. The stroller was again amazingly light! Which makes a big deal when you’re taking it in and out of the trunk! One of the best things about the stroller is when you’re trying to get everything together and you’re taking it out of the trunk, it will stand all on its own. No more trying to maneuver how to deal with a stroller that hasn’t been opened yet…. I like the three wheel system of the stroller, it is much more maneuverable around tight spaces. The peekaboo window was nice to keep an eye on your child. And there are nice storage areas within it. As lightweight as it is it is very sturdy. There was no price listed at the time of this review so I can’t comment on value, but my experience is that century is much less expensive than the bigger name brands and I find that this unit and set competes with them.'}, {'header': 'Great inexpensive system...', 'body': 'This travel system by Century seems to incorporate two different items sold separately by Century into one travel system. The stroller part is the ""Century Stroll On 3-Wheel Lightweight Stroller"" found here (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091MT2L7J?th=1) for $99.99. The car seat part is the ""Century Carry On 35 LX Lightweight Infant Car Seat"" found here (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091MYBV3S) for $129.99.I am almost certain that the stroller in both listings is the same. I\'m not as sure about the car seat, though I suspect it is as well. In the end, if I\'m right, by buying these together you save $65 and get a real bargain of a system.Both items are of exceptional quality for the price. both have removable liners for washing. The car seat comes with a base that uses the LATCH system. It can also be removed from the base to be used in another car with a seat belt or placed on top of the three-wheeled stroller. The stroller can be used as is, without the car seat using its integrated seat, or you can place the car seat facing backward on the stroller.The stroller has a great drawer under the seat for holding items. It has a tray crosspiece in front of the child which can hold toys or food and a canopy.The car seat is exceptionally lightweight. It comes with its own canopy and is easily detached from its base via a handle at its back.This system is a true bargain and worth a strong recommendation. Both pieces are good, together at the price they\'re almost unbeatable.'}]","[{'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81J62ieotlL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Century-Stroll-3-Wheel-Lightweight-Stroller-1.jpg', 'checksum': 'bfc05db060d6e13339dcbd71d7917fa1', 'status': 'downloaded'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TEIoJiNQL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Century-Stroll-3-Wheel-Lightweight-Stroller-2.jpg', 'checksum': 'b5347b1e904f6b07a3efab238f7eceab', 'status': 'downloaded'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gKqwsK8eL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Century-Stroll-3-Wheel-Lightweight-Stroller-3.jpg', 'checksum': '7a4ff43e5af72938a0924cafe0883ae4', 'status': 'downloaded'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Gof4ABzRL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Century-Stroll-3-Wheel-Lightweight-Stroller-4.jpg', 'checksum': '009520e66d2152df1ff51be4d1f1df12', 'status': 'downloaded'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xQ5R0+HTL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Century-Stroll-3-Wheel-Lightweight-Stroller-5.jpg', 'checksum': '738559875f8ead51ca2f185f5f5b8621', 'status': 'downloaded'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WkSjZg5IL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Century-Stroll-3-Wheel-Lightweight-Stroller-6.jpg', 'checksum': 'f6eb8d8e69b4788034f399748e218528', 'status': 'downloaded'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xzn8elHxL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Century-Stroll-3-Wheel-Lightweight-Stroller-7.jpg', 'checksum': 'd23f8f08d088e5eb075df7b83feaa37f', 'status': 'downloaded'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91nBt035H5L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Century-Stroll-3-Wheel-Lightweight-Stroller-8.jpg', 'checksum': '8e2933e449c55e4f135d1f17b2e215cd', 'status': 'downloaded'}]",Berry$$$Metro$$$Splash,Car Seat,"B019EGMGR0,B08WJFRQ91,B00K2ZFHAG,B07S27HVLK,B09NKN9ST8,B00J3KL4HG,B079W46W4L,B07XLG6BJH,B07ZWVKR73,B00ISCPJM6,B07BB5VXBW,B01GVJ65MA,B00O9W4704,B07VHVH7YF,B08DTF8VNC,B089MJNSMW,B08Q1LS11S,B081DB6F4D,B08V3CJ85W,B09KTFYKBK,B07YNDK15M,B019EGMGNE,B004CVDQUO,B07QV3118Z,B08VZK14KZ,B00O8RRRSO,B083XVXV7L,B08RFYHMPW,B08SCNB67G,B08SCPHL1Q,B017VNNTX8,B07MC48TNP,B091B58LFD,B07QTYGYLZ,B08YQ4L4Y7,B08586LYYL,B084K44651,B08TX4K5TJ,B09382PVFM,B084K4BXHP,B07NM559VL,B09NPM265Q,B08PDLGG2L,B0938K24VC,B09311PL54,B08PDKM8HJ,B08YQ1NV6N,B0929L3HV6,B08Z2P55HM,B09881YNV8,B08398MV69,B09LKL9NWZ,B09Q7XFCH5,B095L484LJ,B07L4JPQ64,B07T25WNL3,B06XSMY6Y3,B06XG17VNF,B0728GXF8V,B07FQ6M8CR,B07N28BMB5,B08L9K2MHS,B01N6Z70BR,B087H3XJ49,B07ZS4QBVF,B0921CBPG7,B08K2GX7PP,B071VHBYX8,B09YTN79H7,B07R1CPT7Z,B07DGPGQXN,B071L1NG6N,B006PB2B6O,B08C779LF4,B07L47ZRPW,B00PTL2BE8,B07CZT4M2Y,B06VY1DFQN,B00838BNK2,B07CVCHKTT,B07HML1BT5,B07XTWM2XL,B07H8VTTCP,B07XSC4284,B01N3MYMB2,B01N3MYVZM,B01ETUBQZ4,B07XSBT57H,B07J37RTPG,B07KBPKJYT,B07XSBK4Z2,B01MRE9IOC,B0828M8G61,B07YXP3Y2Z,B07HNTTWY8,B07TGX255N,B09RNDW2LH,B01N5P7G80,B07Y5S4VWT,B07MSPMKPQ",,,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KTFYKBK,,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TEIoJiNQL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gKqwsK8eL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Gof4ABzRL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xQ5R0+HTL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WkSjZg5IL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xzn8elHxL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91nBt035H5L._SL1500_.jpg",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81J62ieotlL._SL1500_.jpg

Holy crap! Now I have seen what the other side is like.It turns out that the hard part of installing a convertible car seat is not figuring out where to route the belt... instead, the hardest part is TIGHTENING the belt sufficiently to allow it to hold this rather LARGE device stationary. How tight does the belt need to be? It needs to be INCREDIBLY tight -- tight enough to compress the car seat against your upholstery. For most car seats, finding a way to achieve the requisite level of tightness takes a LOT of struggling, experimentation, and weird bodily contortions. This is true regardless of if you use a car seat belt or the LATCH (a.k.a. ISOFIX) system to secure your car seat -- you gotta pull HARD, and you gotta pull in exactly the right direction, and you gotta do it all while pressing down on the car seat itself to compress the upholstery underneath. I'm 6 feet tall and weigh over 200 lbs, so I'm not a small guy; yet, I just damn near broke my back trying to secure my other (newer and cheaper) car seat into the back of my Toyota Camry.ENTER the Britax ClickTight system! The ingenious thing about the ClickTight is that the seat-bottom, which opens like a hatch during installation, serves as a self-tightening and self-locking system for your CAR seat belt. You pop the hatch open, you route the belt through the holes, you wiggle the seat so it's well seated, and then ... you close the hatch. Voila! Your belt has been automatically tightened, with the assistance of some nice cam-lever-ish action that converts the moderate force of closing the hatch to a MUCH higher force that tightens AND locks your car's seat belt to the car seat. You don't even need to enable the locking mode on your seat belt (although you can), because the ClickTight has locked the two pieces of the belt together for you.Although the Britax Marathon ClickTight comes equipped with LATCH/ISOFIX, you don't actually need to use the LATCH system with this car seat. In fact, the manufacturer recommends using your car's seat belt with the ClickTight system in lieu of the LATCH system, because the performance of the former is so much better than the latter.Oh, and baby sits like a king in this thing -- it looks and feels so comfortable that I want one for myself. It's also super easy to adjust -- the adjustable harness is awesome. Drawbacks? It's not cheap, and it's hella heavy. But honestly, I couldn't be happier with this car seat, especially now that I've experienced how hard it is to install car seats with more traditional securing mechanisms. This thing is a game-changer!""}, {'header': 'Safe, Easy & Comfortable', 'body': 'I feel good knowing my son is safe in this car seat. He is 8mo now but at his 6mo he was already 30in long. Companies need to easily show their max length not just weight! It’s challenging finding that info!! Anyways, he’s a tall boy and we needed a special rear facing seat for his length. I’m glad we got this one.Pros: EASIEST and most CONFIDENT securing system, easy seatbelt, easy headrest adjustment, clear recline level, nice design, heavy duty, easy to remove cushions for cleaning, very cushioned for his comfort and great RANGE for MAX LENGHT AND WEIGHT for both rear and front facing so we can use this for a long time!Cons: while being rear facing it’s difficult to adjust the recline position bc your hand gets stuck between your car and the carseat, it’s heavy to carry from one car to the next.Side notes: the securing is great but I had a hard time at first preventing the seat from lifting on one side bc it was too tight on the other side. My problem/solution was to not to enable the safety lock (from your car belt) until AFTER you’ve closed and secured your carseat. Then when it’s where you want it, pull your seatbelt until it locks. Not sure if that’s common knowledge but I was the first of my family to have a baby so I didn’t know that before. Hope that helps someone new too!Overall: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, would purchase again if I ever needed to.'}, {'header': 'Favorite seat ever', 'body': 'This is our first convertible seat after using a Graco infant seat for the first 1.5 years. I was looking for a breathable material because my child is always hot and sweaty. I liked that this seat had that option and it seems meshy enough that it *might* work.The biggest reason we chose this one is the strap to tighten it pulls so smoothly and effortlessly. We tried it in the store and were blown away how much easier it was. I got it 3 months ago and I’m loving everything about it. The Graco infant seat was annoying to adjust and I felt I had to pull very hard to get it right enough for my child’s safety, but this is so smooth and easy to pull. This alone has been such a stress reliever when leaving the house.My second favorite feature is the Clicktight mechanism. I’ve heard how difficult and annoying it is to switch convertible seats between cars, but I’m not even joking that it takes two minutes to move this one. I was surprised that it recommends the seatbelt rather than the latch system. It’s SO much faster and easier. No standing on the seat and tugging a strap to tighten it (y’all know you’ve done it!) or breaking your hands trying to undo the latch hooks buried in the abyss of your seat. You just stretch the seatbelt across and close the seat down to clamp it in. I don’t know how it works but it gets a tight fit every single time with zero wiggle. I watched for sales for a long time (these rarely are discounted if at all) and finally bit the bullet on Cyber Monday. I paid about $220. I have no regrets!'}, {'header': 'Fantastic car seat', 'body': ""I have an older version of this car seat and also bought a new one. They've made some really nice enhancements -- the backing doesn't fall off, the seat belts are much nicer and more comfortable and it's much easier to use. Highly recommend!""}, {'header': 'ClickTight installation is well worth the price', 'body': 'I have the ""Advocate"" for my car and have LOVED it. It feels solid, doesn\'t move an inch when installed and is very easy to adjust height as my son grows. It\'s also comfortable and as easy to clean as any carseat. When my son started pre-school, I needed a second carseat that could go back and forth between a few babysitters who occasionally pick him up from school. This carseat is big and heavy so I let myself get talked into a lightweight, lower cost Evenflo seat. Getting those installed securely is a nightmare and it seemed like the straps were always tangled - this did nothing for my feeling of security when someone else was driving my child. I got this Britax Marathon ClickTight on sale, installed it in the babysitter\'s car fairly quickly and will sleep well tonight knowing my child will be safe and secure in this seat. If you\'re planning to move the seat between more than one car or have less than expert folks install it, spend the money on this seat!!!Update 2020: I still love this so much. A good friend gave me a brand new Chicco version of this for my second child and I really tried to use it but nothing installs as rock solid as the click right. I just bought another one. If you want something that you can feel confident will always be securely installed by you, grandparents, a babysitter- this is the car seat you want. 100% worth the cost.'}, {'header': 'Recommend for small car', 'body': 'This car seat was a breeze to install! I have a 2014 Chevy Cruze, which is tiny, but this car seat fits nicely! I tested it out on my big kid and am now currently using it for my infant. My older child loved it, he thought it was so comfortable. My infant seems to like it as well, no tears! If you have a small car and need a more narrow seat, this is it. After lots of research on car seat dimensions and safety, this seemed to be the best choice for my needs... the only draw back i can think of is if you’re tall or have a tall passenger, this seat might not work so well rear facing behind that seat in the “light blue” setting. I have it behind the passenger seat which I moved all the way up and the back rest is very upright in order for the car seat to be where it needs to be.

It’s the kind that I can take out and it fits into my stroller system when we are out and about. He is still under the maximum weight but I was ready to have him in something more comfortable.This seat can still be rear facing but it is more substantially built. Even the infant seat just feels very bare. I also went with a different model than I have used with my other grandkids. This is my first time ever trying the Graco Forever. It seemed like the best option for my money. It goes all the way up to the backless booster. I figure not only can I use it for him but my other grandkids as well. I also chose some thing that was not only gender neutral but isn’t an eyesore either.The seat was easy to install. It has this snug lock technology which is unique. I have not seen that before but it really made tightening the seat a quick process.I like the safety features the seat has as well as all of the extra cushions around the body and head.Some thing I have learned many years ago, two cupholders are always better than one. While that may not a huge deal to some, I am glad to have the two cupholders. I can put a drink and a snack container in each one or a drink and toys in the other.At the current price, I feel like it’s a deal. Like the manufacturer suggests, you can get 10 years of use out of this. To me, that’s pretty incredible. When I divide the cost over 10 years it is very affordable. This brand feels so much more significant than the infant seat (different brand) I had in my car before for my young grandson. I know he’s safe and protected. I think my grandson even looks more comfortable with the position and incline this seat offers.'}, {'header': 'WELL Worth The Money!!', 'body': 'This car seat is GREAT! Not only is Graco a well-known reputable company for baby products and car seats, which in my opinion makes this seat worth the money they\'re asking for it just because of that, but you can get 10 years worth of use out of this thing!! This thing is totally legit! I LOVE that it\'s a 4 in 1, to get so much use out of it. My kids are long grown now, and Graco was around when mine were little lol. But now I have a complete GAGGLE of grandkids lol. I got this one to keep in my vehicle for when I have to go out, when I\'m watching one of the babies. This thing is GREAT for someone like me, where I have grandkids from newborn to pre-teen with every age in between lol. It will meet my needs no matter which grandchild I have with me that day. I\'ve found the seat converts to all of the other stages very easily and quickly. I really appreciate that aspect lol. I can\'t personally attest to the ""comfort"" of it ....but none of my grandkids have complained haha. I always giggle just a little bit when asked to assign a star value to a ""comfort"" catagory when it\'s on an infant/young child item like this because well ....HOW would we know beyond a doubt?! LOL It feels really soft and cushy though! It seems extremely well made, and like I\'ve said before, just it being Graco brand makes it super trust-worthy in my opinion! This is most definitely worth the price they\'re asking for it, for all of the use that you will be able to get out this thing! I HIGHLY recommend it!'}, {'header': 'Wonderful ""Grow with me"" car seat!', 'body': 'I had my eye on the Graco 4Ever DLX SnugLock Grow 4-in-1 Car Seat for awhile and so was so excited when I had the opportunity to get one. I have used many Graco products with my kids.This Maison style is a simple, gender neutral, calm pattern.The seat is strong, solid, thick, high quality. Definitely makes me feel like my kiddo is safe.I did not use this car seat until my kid was too heavy to keep in her Graco SnugRide 35 Lite LX. For infants and ~1 year olds I think it\'s kind of a must to be able to pop the car seat in and out of the car without having to take the kiddo out of the car seat-- especially when they are sleeping, or you need them to have a safe place to rest/sleep/be put down while you are out somewhere.The DLX is a ""stay in your car"" carseat so that is a ""downside"" of its ""grow with me"" features -- you miss out on portability. But after that first year you have the remaining 9 years to really get your money\'s worth with this seat. AND YOU WILL! I know that the adjustability and durability and quality of this seat will last. (For my eldest at one point I had a high-back booster that was a different brand and felt chintzey; I am relieved that with this car seat my second kiddo will have a high-quality high-back booster when she gets to that point.)It is an expensive seat, but not when you factor in how much use you\'ll get out of it -- you won\'t have to by different seats for different stages and so the end this is definitely an economical option (even if you do it like I do and use a infant-specific car seat first).'}, {'header': 'Super comfortable with a ton of features.', 'body': ""This car seat is great, my daughter really looks comfortable and cozy in it. Its easy to install, and once installed it is fairly easy to adjust as needed. The restraints are sturdy and well padded, the seat reclines to 6 positions for both safety and comfort and it has two cup holders, one for drink one for snacks!This car seat also adjusts till your kiddo is out of car seats and boosters, so you won't have to keep buying new chairs, that's a plus in my book.""}, {'header': 'This really does check all the boxes', 'body': ""If you've been looking for an all around good car seat that you can install and forget, the Graco 4Ever DLX SnugLock Grow 4-in-1 is a solid choice. There's honestly a lot to like about this car seat. It's very easy to use in terms of height adjustment, recline function, easy release LATCH hooks, and belt storage. Everything on the seat is clearly printed with large font. Installation with the seat belt is also very easy with a latch that can be unlocked easily and clipped back on. This is a convertible car seat that can be used both forward facing and rear facing. With its height extending back cushion, this allows the chair to grow with your child. All the fabric pieces can be easily removed for cleaning as well. Most of it is either velcroed, hooked, or looped in place. One very very minor drawback that I can speak to is the quality of the fabric/foam material. I do feel like they could add slightly more cushion to it. The other callout I'd like to make is that if you have a compact car, the car seat is more of a standard size especially with the cupholders in place. So if you have a need to install 3 in the back row of your car or SUV, it may not fit. I've added some close-up photos of the car seat. Hopefully this helps with your car seat search. I know it's difficult with so many options out there!""}, {'header': 'Worth the Cost!', 'body': ""This is the one and done car seat! Buy this for your baby and you'll literally never need another seat! It's easy to install, so plush and comfortable and everything about this seat just seems well thought out and designed to make parents lives easier... and your kiddos trips more comfortable! I love how easy this is to adjust to the perfect fit. Another huge perk is how easy it is to remove the cover for washing when the inevitable blowout/puking/milk spill happens. I've literally thrown a car seat in the trash before because there was no way to get all the puke out of the padding and cracks and crevices. Parenthood is messy, and Graco has factored that into the seat design. On my old Graco Extend2Fit, one of my biggest annoyances was the square cup holders. I have literally never found a cup that actually fits in the cup holder. Why would anyone in their right mind design square cup holders? Fortunately this has two round cup holders that fit cups and water bottles no problem. This is definitely more on the pricey side as seats go, but for the headache is saves, the comfort and safety it provides, and the fact that this is literally the only car seat you will ever need to buy, it's worth the cost!""}, {'header': 'Tons of helpful features', 'body': ""This is really a deluxe car seat in many ways. There are a lot of small features that are noticeable compared to other car seats.The shoulder pads have non-slip material on the bottom so they stay in place as you tighten the belt. The shoulder straps move up and down with the headrest, where many other car seats require you to reroute the shoulder straps as your child grows. The headrest goes WAY up so you can use the safer car seat harness when you would have transitioned to a booster for other car seats.The list goes on. For 40+ lbs front-facing car seat mode you secure the seat with the seatbelt rather than LATCH system. This car seat has a special latch that grasps onto the car's seatbelt to help keep it securely in place. The access to the front facing special latch is under the seat back cushion, but no worries as the seat cushion easily flips up and unsnaps.If you have to loosen the top strap to remove the seat, you don't have to hold down some button and push the strap through-- just flip it up and the strap will loosen easily. On top of all this there are very detailed step-by-step instructions in English and Spanish booklets for each style of installation.My daughter was impressed with the double removable cup holders. Removable is a huge feature because we all know nasty bits of stuff will end up in the bottom of the cup holder! She also said the seat was very comfortable overall.Of course the fact that the seat supports booster, booster with back, rear and front facing means that this can be the only car seat you need. I think it is great!""}, {'header': 'Love my graco forever car seat！！', 'body': ""Installing it securely is a breeze and only takes a few minutes. Once the seat belt is in and tightened, the seat belt in our SUV does not allow it to move or move...I say this because it is very important to install it correctly, because it is for the safety and protection of the child I love that as my daughter grows we don't have to take it out to adjust the straps because there's a simple button to move the headrest up and adjust the straps! It has plenty of room in the shoulder area, widens as the headrest moves up, and the headrest is big enough for older kids too,I love the the seat come with removable padded inserts that can easily be removed or put in if your kiddo needs some extra cushion. In addition the cover on the car seat is easily removable as well in the instance you need to remove and wash the seat cover.Overall, the Graco 4Ever DLX SnugLock Grow 4-in-1 Car Seat is a well designed car seat with durability and longevity —10 years！""}, {'header': 'Another high quality car seat from Graco', 'body': ""We needed a second car seat for my daughter, and we already know we can trust Graco from experience with past products (and our older kids).

Great latch system (and latches around the back of the seat as well).Comfortable for longer trips for my little.Has the buckle pockets, which are great for small babes (put the buckles in the pocket, so you don't have to dig them out from under your kid).Has 3 recline positions when forward facing, so we can recline when we're traveling at night, and know our kid will fall asleep.Love that it turns into a highback booster, and a booster seat, so it's the only car seat you'll ever need.Cannot recommend highly enough.Also comes with great padding, when using for a new little squish.

I didn’t have any problem with the seat locking mechanism.'}, {'header': 'Great seat with style', 'body': ""Great seat that grows with the kids as they outgrow everything at light speed.The seat back adjusts in height AND width.The material quality is awesome.It's got cup & snack holders that can be hidden when things are tight or they aren't needed.The latch attachments are easy and quick to install or remove.There's a seat belt guide that moves with the seat back as it adjusted so the belt is always at the right place for your little one.And the seat is solid, but light weight so it's not a pain to change it between cars.""}, {'header': 'Couldn’t be happier with this big kid booster!', 'body': 'I bought this for my 7 year old for Nissan Altima because it was on the list of boosters that would fit my car right according to the manufacturer. The newer recommendations say kids shouldn’t ride backless boosters until around 10. This seat fits perfectly and she has plenty of room without even having to expand the wings. I am so pleased. The headrest doesn’t get in the way when I raise it. My child is comfortable and I love the extra support around the head and on the sides. That’s a must have for me. Ever watch the crash safety tests on the boosters without that side support? It’s scary. It’s easy to put together, lightweight but durable, and we will use it until she grows out of it.'}, {'header': 'We love it!', 'body': 'It’s an amazing booster seat for children! My daughter is 6 and around 56 lbs. this seat had plenty of room for her to grow in to but it’s also great to size in and make it snug on her small frame. The cup holders are super easy for her to pull out and push in. She can easily buckle and unbuckle her self now. The ease of transferring this seat to another car is amazing, no more fighting for 15 minutes or longer!'}, {'header': 'Would buy again.', 'body': 'I love this seat enough that I bought one for my mom too. The only hiccup is that when buckling my daughter in you have to really pull your own seat belt with a little strength if it’s run through the allotted seat belt holder which makes me worried I will give my daughter a seat belt burn when forcibly pulling it through. Secondarily, it is strange that the two pieces (seat & back) do not “snap” together. They fold together and you immediately sit the seat in the car. Otherwise, fab!!'}, {'header': 'Very sturdy booster seat', 'body': 'I bought this for my 13 year old daughter who is a dwarf. I needed something that would be able to support an older child, not look “babyish”, and seat her comfortably. We had a 2 day drive, 10 hours a day, and she didn’t complain once about being uncomfortable. The head supports made napping comfortable for her as well. If you are looking for a sturdy seat for a larger child and you do not need to put more than 2 seats in your back seat (it’s much bigger than the Safety 1st seat I had)—this booster seat exceeded my expectations.'}, {'header': 'Comfy, safe,  old style clip latch', 'body': ""It is not the EASY click latch.. I did not see this when I ordered and it was difficult getting the latches installed in my vehicle. I ordered 3 of these seats. My son that got the red one loves it and says it's very comfy! I did alot of research on safety and am overall very happy.""}, {'header': 'Amazing seats.', 'body': 'LOVE LOVE LOVE these seats. These are super nice seats. I wish I would have gone with Diono when we got our first booster seats. They are heavy which makes them feel nice. I love the head support and feel it will definitely help protect in an accident. I do love that the sides expand as kids get older. Great seats. Highly recommend.'}, {'header': 'Comfy seat', 'body': ""My son is 7yrs old and doesn't meet the weight or height requirement yet. However this car seat is very comfy and easy for him to buckle up easily!""}, {'header': 'Easy enough to handle with one hand.', 'body': 'I owned a Diono 3RXT which converts into a booster but my girl needed something with more width. So I upgraded her to a Diono booster. SHE LOVES IT. It is so light and easy to install. I would really recommend the Diono brand to anyone after owning 2 myself. The design is smart and no nonsense. Fabric is easy to clean, easy to take off and slip on. I love having the freedom without asking for help. I would recommend this.'}, {'header': 'Big girl booster', 'body': 'The look in person is just as great from the online picture.

I was a bit worried because the condition was listed as good like new and I didn\'t know what to expect. I orderd it with prime on a Friday late afternoon and the order said it would be delivered Tuesday by 8pm. I was a little disappointed that it wouldn\'t come on Monday to make the 2 day shipping prime promise, and yes I am taking into account for Sunday, and most things I order on a Friday night are delivered by Monday night but whatever it\'s just one extra day I suppose. Anyway the seat came on Tuesday in the afternoon of course during the only 20 minutes I left all morning and went to the store lol. When I got home and saw it I was so excited. On initial examination the box had a tear in the top corner but seemed otherwise fine. I took it inside and opened it up and took out the seat. It was wrapped in a plastic bag and had a kind of zip tie at the top. I pulled the bag off and started a through close examination of the seat. The tags were attached to the seat as if it had never been opened, the instruction manual was there, warranty paperwork was there, everything, all parts and such seemed to be in original factory boxed condition. The seat was clean and smelled brand new like it had never been opened. I started checking the mechanics of it making sure every little thing worked as it should. Yep everything worked. I picked it up and shook it and no rattle of loose screws or broken parts. I took off the padding and made sure all the impact foam was there. Yep all there. Checked the manufacturer date. Yep 2014. So for $280 I got the top of the line fabric and leather licorice version all because the only thing wrong was the box was torn on a corner and the label was a bit rough looking. From what I can tell the seat is brand new never opened or used in anyway and I couldn\'t be happier!Now I ordered this seat because#1 peg perego makes THE BEST and SAFEST car seats#2 the small footprint of the base looked as though it would work between the 2 booster seats that need to accompany this one in my back seat for my other two older kids. I drive a 2000 Chevy Impala and it does have a roomy back seat area but any parent of multiple small children will know having 3 seats in the back of your car makes things tight. With this seat my older 2 are still able to buckle their seat belts just fine. This peg perego convertible is so roomy for my littlest man too but the way the base is there is still room for an adult with large hands to buckle the other seats no problem. The seat is simple to install and only took me about a minute literally. I have it rear facing right now but even a forward facing position was simple. I did it both ways just to see. Although the seat is roomy it doesn\'t affect the front seats at all while in the rear facing position.Now for comfort in my opinion this has got to be awsone. The seat is super soft and I wish I could sit in it to try out. But alas I can not so I have to go by how my son reacts in it. The first car ride in this seat was to pick up big brother from school. My little guy had been awake for about 15/20 min from an hour nap. Usually this means there\'s no way in hell he\'s going back to sleep any time soon. I put my son in this seat buckled him in and he looked at it checking it out as I got in and started the car. About 2 blocks into our 8 min drive to the school I look back and my little man is passed out. This never happens unless it\'s a trip at nap time. I thought to myself well maybe he was just still tired. I get to the school pick up brother and back into the car we go, and right back to sleep my little man goes. Ok I think he must still be tired. Well after 4 days of having this seat I am amazed at how much my little guy is sleeping in the car. He is that comfortable. He falls asleep all the time in this seat every time we go somewhere. He hasn\'t done this since he was an infant. I even took the seat and put it in my living room on the floor to see if he\'d sit in it and go to sleep and sure enough he did. If that doesn\'t say he loves the seat and it must be comfortable I don\'t know what does.All in all I couldn\'t be happier with this seat and I am thrilled I got such a great deal on it from Amazon warehouse. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAR SEAT! Oh and on a side note I wish I had gotten this seat when my son was an infant because that infant insert is so thick and cushy I can\'t imagine a small baby not being comfortable sitting on it. I also recommend trying to buy this on sale through the Amazon warehouse because, well, who doesn\'t want to save money?!'}, {'header': 'Amazing Car Seat!', 'body': ""This is such a nice car seat. I originally bought a Clek Fllo for my 6 month old but returned it the very next day, it was hard as a rock. I'm sorry but I'm just not going to make my baby sit in that for hours at a time. When my Peg seat came I knew within 5 seconds that this was a keeper. It is luxuriously soft and comfortable and so well made. It is easy to use and SO EASY to install rear facing with latch and I got a really tight install the first time.Their independent latch system is so great, it is very easy to get a tight install because each side tightens. I also LOVE that this seat allows rear facing tethering to prevent rebound.I also love that you can rear face for a long time with this seat, and it also has great leg room rear facing. The safety features are top notch with this seat and you also get the comfort and quality. It is well worth the price in my opinion. It also looks really good, it has a great design. It also has a pretty compact footprint so won't take up a lot of room. I have a minivan and have it installed in the 2nd row captain's chair and I can have the passenger seat all the way back when this seat is rear facing. It takes up less room than my infant carrier did front to back (Britax Chaperone.) Also it isn't as high up as some other convertibles so it doesn't block my vision while I'm driving. My son cried on every car trip in his infant carrier but has never cried once after switching to this seat. He can see my other kids and look out the window and he loves it. I also know because of the amazing padding and comfort that he is very comfortable in this seat. This seat is easy to tighten the harness once you get the hang of it. Also I think it's kind of hard to tell from the picture but the Atmosphere color is a dark gray with black accents. It looks really slick, I love it. My only small complaint is the same as other reviewers, the harness pads are super long so I couldn't get the harness properly snug and keep the chest clip at armpit level but Peg Perego doesn't require you to use them. And because their harness straps and nice and wide set they don't rub my baby's neck. I will save them for when he gets older. Fantastic car seat, don't hesitate to get it!""}, {'header': 'Safe, Easy to Install, Comfortable and Stylish', 'body': 'So far we absolutely love this seat. I had the hardest time deciding which convertible seat to buy, and did extensive research between multiple brands. To save you hours of hassle and sum it up, I landed on the Peg Perego because of:1. Fantastic safety ratings. I\'m all about a bargain baby buy usually, but when it comes to a safety item, like a car seat, I want the best! The side impact protection on this seat is fabulous. Our child rides in the outboard position so this was especially important to me.2. Ease of use/cleaning: no re-thread needed to adjust the shoulder straps. Cover is removable and machine washable.3. Rear facing capacity up to 45 lbs. We can keep our daughter safe and rear facing for a long time to come!4. Comfort. The nice breathable fabric keeps our daughter comfortable even on hot summer days. I\'ve already noticed she\'s no longer sweaty when I pull her out. It also sits up nice and high so she can see well out of the window.5. Installation took me just a few minutes. It was super easy, uses your cars LATCH connectors, and also has a rear tethering strap for extra protection. I still have plenty of room in the front seat and you can definitely still fit two other people in the back row.4. Look. And, to top it off, the seat just looks great! We got a light tan color that basically matches the interior of my car. It blends in like it was meant to be!So far our daughter loves her ""big girl chair"" and truly seems happy riding in it. The only downside of this seat is the high price, but again, while I\'ll bargain shop on other baby related items, this is one area where I was ok with spending a little more money to get top of the line safety protection.'}, {'header': 'LOVE LOVE LOVE this car seat', 'body': ""LOVE LOVE LOVE this car seat. It was totally worth the price. I did lots of extensive research on car seats and even ordered a different car seat before I changed my mind and cancelled that order and decided to get this one instead. I am SO glad I did.-I love that it has the tether in rear facing mode, it makes the car seat SUPER secure.-I love how comfortable my baby is in it with the memory foam padding.-I love the sliding headrest that will grow with baby.-I love how easy the straps are to adjust. But they're still secure enough that they don't slide around once I put them in place.-I love that it fits very comfortably in my Jeep compass in the middle seat, neither of the front seats need to be pushed forward at all, there's plenty of space for it.Here are my two (very minor) complaints:1.) I didn't like that I had to purchase a cup holder separately and the cup holder is fairly flimsy for the price. My son can't really reach his cup in the cupholder yet, but I imagine as he grows, he'll be able to reach it just fine. However, that is such a minor complaint that it wouldn't deter me from buying this car seat again and again if I had to.2.) The shoulder strap covers are too big for my son right now... they didn't allow the chest buckle to go all the way up to where it was supposed to be, so I had to remove them. I ended up just putting his infant car seat strap covers on for now and they work fine and I imagine that as my son grows, I will put the ones that came with the carseat back on.Overall, I would 100% recommend this car seat to anyone and everyone. It was totally worth the price. I LOVE my Peg.""}, {'header': 'Great fit for Mazda 3', 'body': 'I won\'t reiterate what you can read in a dozen other helpful, thorough reviews of this car seat. I will say the following, as it seems difficult to find out how car seats will fit in particular cars, and this will obviously vary greatly:I have a 2008 Mazda 3. I never thought of it being a ""compact""car until we tried to put car seats in it!We first purchased the Maxi Cosi Pria 70, which I have had my eye on since my kid was born, practically, because they\'re just so darn attractive! She is still rear facing, and the only position we could install the seat in and still be able to drive the car was in the center of the back seat in position 2, which is a very upright and uncomfortable looking position! This seat is so tall that it was difficult to put her in or take her out of the seat without bumping her head on the roof of the car. Also, it created a giant blind spot for me. So, we sent it back, and ordered this one.Amazing! She is comfortably reclined, and I swear it barely takes up any more space than her Britax B-Safe infant seat did. It doesn\'t obstruct my view, and it\'s easy to slide her in and out of the seat. Also, it\'s not hideous! Hallelujah. It\'s nicely padded, beautiful fabric, and although the straps do twist sometimes, they\'re easier to keep out of the way than the Britax was. We still have her in the center of the back seat, because it is too big to put behind the driver or passenger and have them seated comfortably, but that\'s the safest place for it anyway. I love, love, love it!'}, {'header': 'Safe. Comfortable. Badass.', 'body': 'Replaced my safety first car seat, possibly the best purchase I’ve made. Solid, sturdy and safe. My son loves the comfort and no longer throws a fit when going into the car. Easy install, bigger than anticipated but will fit comfortably into a sedan, truck, or SUV. Compact cars may be an issue.MATERIALS:Leather/vinyl material on sides with a breathable material which is very soft and padded well (almost like cooling gel) in the center from border to border.STRAPS:Took less than five minutes to install, easy and secure. Two straps with clips, as well as fastening areas for the OEM seatbelt.OTHER:Looks great, I was looking for something similar to what I had growing up, but I found something so much better. I drive a 73 Chevy nova and now my son can vibe in a safe, comfortable, and badass car seat for many years to come.

I was so happy with how it looked whe we first received the product. My husband thought that we could have been find with a less costly convertible but after having it for a couple months, my husband has changed his tune. This isn't our first rodeo in the car seat arena being that this was purchased for our 3rd child. I did more research this time around since my son has very bad reflux. My son also tends to run warm and sweats pretty easily. Living in Southern California does not help.The convertible car seat was easy to install and the fabric was easy to remove for cleaning. It still looks and smells brand new even after having multiple episodes of projectile vomiting and blowout episodes that I thought would have ruined the seat by now. Our son also looks much more comfortable, sleeps easily, and last through long trips in this seat. My only regret was not purchasing the seat sooner. I have even recommended it to friends. It is so easy to adjust for different heights without taking out the seat. I tend to go shopping with my sister who usually brings her daughter along. My sister no longer has to bring her high back booster for her daughter when going out with me. It is easy to adjust the seat for her size. We noticed that my niece easily falls asleep and looks more comfortable in the convertible too.""}, {'header': 'Easy to clean, never gets hot, comfortable.', 'body': 'We have had this carseat for 18 months now and we love it. I got motivated to write the review when it came the time to remove the cover and wash it. I was thrilled to realize that the cover came off so easily and that I was able to wash it in the washer (I did cold setting) and it looks amazing. I have to say this carseat cover never looks dirty anyway but my toddler spilled some liquid soap on it so I had to wash it. I think this is the coolest (as in temperature) carseat out there. It never gets hot to the touch. The leather-like part gets warm but never hot and that does not touches your child while sitting. It breathes really well to. My child is never sweaty on he back when I pull her out.I have say that the only issue I have with it is the following: I was planning to keep my toddler rare-facing well beyond the age of 2 but the carseat has a height limit for rear-facing and at the 2nd birthday, we are just one click away from that limit. I must say that my child is at 99 percentile and possibly over 100 percentile.We also have a Britax Boulevard and Peg Perego Convertible Premium is by far the nicer one of the two. Even my husband says it and he typically prefers value over quality unlike me.'}, {'header': 'Great [Extended Rear Facing] Car Seat', 'body': 'Review by Wife- The Peg Perego Primo Viaggio came up on the top of our list after doing extensive research on convertible car seats. I reviewed safety performance, especially the benefits of extended rear facing, as well as comfort, function, aesthetics, footprint & ratings. Honestly, the list of contenders get quite short when you want to rear face your precious cargo for as long as possible. This seat goes up to 45 pounds, that\'s amazing!We picked up this model in Atmosphere, which matches the black leather interior perfectly. It has been used the past 3-4 months in the second car, while still using the infant carseat in the primary car. As long as it is well reclined, I feel as though this car seat offered more comfort than the primary seat. & if you\'re fine skipping the whole removable bucket seat phase, the Peg Perego is a great option from Day One. It comes with a wedge type insert that\'ll help keep the baby in that cozy super reclined position. Do note, the shoulder straps are on a longer side. The car seat itself is soft, plush, does it\'s job moisture wicking & the cover is a easy enough to remove. It offers side protection without being so claustrophobic.Loving this car seat so much, I just ordered a second in the ""sports"" trim'}, {'header': 'Safe and comfortable', 'body': ""We've been using the Peg Perego over a year now, and I would absolutely buy it again. The seat is extremely easy to install and adjust for growth. Ours gets moved between cars regularly, but it's not hard to swap and secure. The seat isn't light at 18lbs, but safety is my first priority in a car seat. And the steel frame gives protection that some car seats lack, so the weight is worth it to me. Secondarily, the cover is relatively easy to take off and wash. And, based on my son's reaction, it's also very comfortable with a lot of cushioning. The only thing it's missing is a cup holder.""}, {'header': ""Can't recommend it enough!"", 'body': ""After much research I decided to get this car seat since I was not happy with the previous one I had (Safety First Complete Air 65). I LOVE this seat. It installed rather easily and very, very securely in my Acura TL using the Latch system. This is my third car seat and it is the only one that I felt 100% confident in the installation. I also like that you can tether it while it is rear-facing to help stabilize the seat while the car is in motion. The sides are not so high that I have difficulty getting my 19 month old in and out of the seat, which is good because I hope to rear-face until she reaches the height/weight limit. The harness tightens, loosens, and releases easily and so far the straps have not twisted on me, which was a frequent occurrence with our infant bucket seat (Britax B Safe) and Safety First seat. My only complaint about this car seat was that I had a little trouble getting the Latch system out of the bottom of the seat where it is stored when you first buy it. Other than that I am extremely happy and despite the steep price we will be buying two more for her father and grandfather's cars.""}, {'header': 'Great Seat if you get the Right Version', 'body': ""I really like Peg Perego and was initially happy with this car seat; however, my two year old figured out how to unbuckle the chest strap fairly quickly. She did it all the time while were driving. I called Peg Perego and they immediately sent me a the older version chest strap free of charge. Peg has excellent customer service. What I came to realize is that the newer version of this car seat has a different chest strap than the older version. In order to release the older chest strap you have to push in two places on the top and bottom of the chest clip; with the newer strap you only push in one place that is front and center on the chest clip (my car seat was manufactured in Feb 2016). So I definitely recommend this seat as long as you get the chest clip that can only be released when pushed in two places (older version). My daughter stays cool and is comfortable in it (we live in sunny, hot south Florida), it is easy to install, the fabric comes off fairly easily to wash, and it doesn't take up a lot of space in my SUV (2015 Lexus RX350).""}, {'header': 'Awesome buy!!', 'body': 'Read all the instructions!!

He isn't due until April so we actually haven't used it yet, but if it's the same exact thing as the black one (which I assume it is) we'll love it just as much.The only negative I can think of: our firstborn was a bit on the taller side and outgrew sitting comfortably backfacing when he was around 18 months. His legs were cramped against the backrest of our roomy SUV (ML350, passenger side) and we made the pretty harrowing decision as first time parents to switch him to forward facing. My sister came to visit when he was around 22 months and backward facing in her rental SUV (Equinox) was a no go as well. In terms of forward facing, there's plenty of room for him to grow with the adjustable back and I love that the sides are high enough to keep his noggin protected for years to come.""}, {'header': 'Good product', 'body': 'Easy to install.

We recently traveled to the Galapagos islands it was my daughters first time on an airplane, we took the seat on the plane and she enjoyed the 10 hour trip. If you have 2 it will take up the entire back seat of your car with a 12"" of clearance in the middle.

The installation was not as easy but not too difficult either. I've had to move it a couple times and that part does seem to get easier with each move/re-installation. It is heavy but feels very well built and safe. With it rear-facing, we had to put it behind the passenger seat as it would not fit behind the driver side (although my husband does like to have his seat pretty far back). I can't speak to the removal and cleaning of the seat cover, but I have surface-cleaned it and that was very easy to do.

I read a lot of reviews that talked about people using pool noodles and towels to adjust the recline of the seat, but that just didn't see safe to me.I didn't want to spend this much on a seat, but the Peg was my last option.

It is also easy to dismantle the car seat and wash all the fabric. If you forget how to put the pieces back on, the instructions are in the manual that comes with it. I forgot about that so I used a youtube video posted by UPPABABY to reassemble. Reassembly is also quite simple.It's SO smooth to push and navigate. The cargo space underneath is awesome!

Especially the head support for the newborn option, worth the extra money for that'}, {'header': 'GRACO stepped up to high end seats : Comfortable tank ride for baby - easy setup for parent', 'body': 'I always felt Graco is falling behind the Britax and Evenflo in the infant carseat department but SnugFit 35 Elite is a whole new game and here’s why.Graco made it easy to install this seat by providing us with a several different ways to install it AND a guides on the seat itself so you cannot make a mistake. Seat has illustrated stickers making it a breeze. You can install this carseat with the base or without the base which is helpful if you’re taking Uber ride for instance. You can fold your stroller and put it in the trunk and secure carseat without the base on the back seat. At the end of the ride, you’ll just pop the carseat on the stroller, no big bulky base to haul around.Second thing about this seat is very generous and dense padding. More generous than other Graco seats I’ve seen. Rebound bar provides extra protection in case of (God forbid) direct crash. It’s generously sized, thick and bulky. The seat is deep providing a lot of space around child’s body and head. Harness is adjustable to fit kids different size, 4lbs-35lbs and 32” tall. It’s simple once you figure out how, hint: you need to remove the fabric. As the baby grows you will also end up removing the infant insert to make more space for growing baby. I think I am going to make a YouTube video demonstrating how. Buckle is simple to operate for the parent but childproof.Canopy is deep and works well, doesn’t make a noise that would wake a baby.This is also the first and only seat (that I know off) that allows you to adjust the carrying handle SINGLE HANDED. All other seats I’ve seen need both hands and it’s annoying.I think I should just say that everything is adjustable for a perfect fit. The base, incline, the seat, they even included bubble leveling indicator to help you find the proper incline. This will vary from vehicle to vehicle because different models backseats will have different incline of their own.In summary, this is a comfortable tank ride.'}, {'header': 'Wonderful Rear Facing Infant Seat', 'body': ""We tested several car seats and found that with all the changes they are making to the designs, I'm actually having some trouble lifting these things. This one is very very sturdy, very strong, well built, secure, but I can still carry it. For a child growing older, with a seat that adjusts for an aging child, you can leave it in the car once they reach a certain age, but before that you want to be able to carry it and I found that this was still good for carrying, even though it is very secure and that brings a little added weight. I feel safe lifting it and working with it.I am impressed with the smoothness of motion of the movable parts, with how easy it was to set up initially, with how comfortable it seems to be as their new baby slept all the way from their home to ours on the couple of days that we babysat for them. The fabric wipes clean very easily and the material seems very durable.I really couldn't find a flaw with this and I looked pretty hard for one, because I almost always find one, but this seems just perfect. I'd love to see a variety of colors of course, but the car seat is just wonderful. Beyond that, this is trusted name in car seats, so I feel safe using this.Overall, this is a five star car seat, especially compared to what we had before, and is working very very well. I'm looking forward to seeing how it works in a couple of years, but so far it's really been very easy to work with. This is not designed to grow up with your child, but it is designed to keep a baby extra safe in the early stages, before you switch to a seat for a toddler. I love this seat and I'm very impressed. Good luck in your search.""}, {'header': 'Safe, Convenient, and Stylish', 'body': ""This new Graco infant car seat is one of the best we've seen. It has a ton of nice safety features and is convenient/adjustable, not to mention it's probably too attractive for a baby who will likely defecate and spill food all over it within 24 hours.Safety:The anti-rebound bar looks important and effective though I'm not going to put it to the test. It's plastic (basically the whole frame is), but it's heavy-duty plastic. The straps are standard seat belt straps and are going to be fine if adjusted properly for the little one. I really love the firm and adjustable headrest. Our old one had a cheesy padded liner to use as the headrest. All of our kids made it, but we never got in an accident. I think this firm surround head rest reduces the risk as much as possible. The built-in level for the seat mount is handy.Convenience:Everything is adjustable and efficient. The headrest slider is great and very easy to use. The straps are less easy to use but it's worth it for the safety aspect. There's a removable cover for the legs and feet, which I don't think will last very long though it does look comfy. Our 18-month-old wanted to fit inside really bad but alas, she's going to have to let a little sibling enjoy it.Another great thing about this car seat is that it fits into all the other Graco stuff we have, most notably the stroller, so you won't have to get another stroller to match if you already have a Click-Connect one.Style:It looks like a work of art right out of the box but that's before Jackson Pollack has his way with it if you know what I mean. I highly recommend no food in the car, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.""}, {'header': 'Close to luxury car seat.', 'body': ""I requested this car seat for my 5 month old. He's always been in the 90 something percentile for height and fits this car seat great. The seat itself is very comfortable and plush, I particularly like the headrests that help keep his head propped up. The canopy is a little awkward to adjust at times. I love that to adjust the handle is so easy with just the push of one button at the top. The base was super easy to install in our Nissan Murano, and we only had to move the seat in front up just a hair more because of the anti-rebound bar. We've also been able to strap it into the back seat of our Ford Ranger no problem with plenty of space for my husband to drive. We've been able to click connect this car seat in our Graco Double stroller no problem. We've only used the included cover once and it kept our 'little' guy pretty toasty in the spring air.""}, {'header': 'Extremely Nice Car Seat', 'body': 'We finally bought a second car, so we needed a second car seat.

From attaching the base to the car to adjusting the height and belts and carrying everything is easy and you don’t need 2 hands. Thats the best thing on this carseat, you can install the base with one hand, adjust de handle with one hand, and adjust the height with one hand. Amazing! The headrest can be adjusted very easily as the baby growth.It is very well padded and the baby looks comfortable in it.

When you unzip the canopy it has mesh for airflow. I like how easy it is to buckle in and unbuckle the child.

So when I chose this as an option for my daughter’s first child, I knew that she would be safe using it. The car seat arrived in a very large box. While this doesn’t affect how the product is used it does affect how much room you have to store it if you don’t plan on using it right away. The color is pretty neutral and should match most accessories. The padding in it is very soft and the frame of the seat is very sturdy. The handle of the seat has been a little stiff and it can be a little difficult to maneuver over the top of the collapsible shade, but I think that’s probably the case of most car seats. It seems to be a very sturdy, trustworthy car seat that will keep children safe.'}, {'header': 'Sturdy, easy to install, easy to snap in and out, convenient useful covers', 'body': 'I get Graco products for my niece because i trust their record of safety.

This seat has more padding. I wanted my baby to be safe and happy in her new seat. It is easy to install and it seems to be made really well. I like how the leveler is located on the side and easy to read how the seat should be reclined according to weight. The seat looks big but doesn't take up too much space in the back.

Once unboxed I read the manual and got it all setup then went outside to get it in the car so it could be used. This is a much easier to use car seat than the ones I've used previously, adjusting the seat in the car without losing your mind is possible with this seat, although I would certainly suggest reading the manual and not just quickly looking over it.Overall, this is going to be a great car seat that will last us a long time, and that makes it one less thing we must worry about as new parents, and I really appreciate the versatility of this product. 5/5 stars.""}, {'header': 'Just what I was looking for', 'body': 'This is exactly what I needed. Great quality and easy to install. Highly recommend'}, {'header': 'Works from birth to 10 years old! Wow!', 'body': 'Had I known that this product existed, I would have purchased it way sooner. Chicco\'s car seat works from birth to 100lbs. That means this product will be suitable until your kid is 10-11 years old. Luckily convertible and boosters usually last up to 10 years. The only downside is that the warranty is only 1 year, whereas other brands like Uppababy might be more expensive, but they offer a ""lifetime"" warranty.For car seats, this is in the upper price range at $299.99 at the time of this review. I honestly have nothing negative to say about this car seat. Chicco made a single product you can use as your child grows up instead of trying to gauge more money from their customer base. The price is very reasonable for what it is.The car seat is simple to operate; it supports car latches and seat belts. You can use it both rear or front facing. They have places to hide the straps when it\'s not in use. There are two cup holders and it acts as a recliner. If I didn\'t know any better, I\'d think this was an IMAX theater seat. It surely feels luxurious, and my child isn\'t complaining about being strapped in.The only drawback would be that this is bigger and bulkier, but at 25lbs, it\'s actually the same weight as an infant car seat.'}, {'header': 'The only car seat you will need!', 'body': 'This is such a great seat. We needed another so I didn\'t have to keep switching it. I loved this one so much that it\'s permanent in my car which is used most often. This is one seat that fits for life. It goes from a rear-facing harness (5–40 lbs.) to forward-facing harness (25–65 lbs.) to booster (40–100 lbs.) This adjusts and gives plenty of leg room which means they can stay rear facing longer. The frame is steel reinforced which means it really is the only seat your kids needs. This sear is also made with 0 chemicals which is a huge bonus when your a new mom. I like the ""SuperCinch"" this has. It allows you to get the seat as tight as possible which is super important! The seat I got is gray but is definitely gender neutral. It has been great and I wouldn\'t want anything else!'}, {'header': 'Did not find any drawbacks', 'body': 'I absolutely adore this car seat. First of all, it is well-cushioned. Not too puffy ( like Evenflo), so the newborn will not be squished all over and sweaty.

First of all, it has nine recline positions to adjust which is better than the 6-position that we had before. The cushion is quite comfortable and my daughter loves sitting on it. More importantly (Fig. 6), the shape of the back-support cushion is a triangle which is super nice since I always worried about the spine support when used for a baby in the rear-facing position.I used to suffer placing two car seats next to each other in the rear passenger seat because the cup holder took too much space. The design of the cup holder for this product offers a great solution. Now the rear passenger seat could fit two car seats plus a vacant seat for an adult. We really love it.'}, {'header': 'Amazing!', 'body': ""This is such a great car seat! We got it because my son had outgrown his rear facing infant seat. This chair is fantastic! He is so comfortable with it in the front facing position. I hear zero complaints about comfort. It was easy enough to install. The seat itself is very padded and looks comfortable. I like that you can adjust the tightness on the straps while he is in the chair. The cupholders are a fun and convenient touch. I wish I had just bought one of these originally because you can use it rear facing as well as a booster.

The seat seems well made and will keep baby safe. I was trying to decide between this seat and one other that was cheaper. I decided on the Chicco because it seems that the designers put a bit more love into it. The seats were very similar but there was something that helped me decide on the seat. This seat has more padding. I wanted my baby to be safe and happy in her new seat. It is easy to install and it seems to be made really well. I like how the leveler is located on the side and easy to read how the seat should be reclined according to weight. The seat looks big but doesn't take up too much space in the back.

Once unboxed I read the manual and got it all setup then went outside to get it in the car so it could be used. This is a much easier to use car seat than the ones I've used previously, adjusting the seat in the car without losing your mind is possible with this seat, although I would certainly suggest reading the manual and not just quickly looking over it.Overall, this is going to be a great car seat that will last us a long time, and that makes it one less thing we must worry about as new parents, and I really appreciate the versatility of this product. 5/5 stars.""}, {'header': 'Just what I was looking for', 'body': 'This is exactly what I needed.

Chicco\'s car seat works from birth to 100lbs. That means this product will be suitable until your kid is 10-11 years old. Luckily convertible and boosters usually last up to 10 years. The only downside is that the warranty is only 1 year, whereas other brands like Uppababy might be more expensive, but they offer a ""lifetime"" warranty.For car seats, this is in the upper price range at $299.99 at the time of this review. I honestly have nothing negative to say about this car seat. Chicco made a single product you can use as your child grows up instead of trying to gauge more money from their customer base. The price is very reasonable for what it is.The car seat is simple to operate; it supports car latches and seat belts. You can use it both rear or front facing. They have places to hide the straps when it\'s not in use. There are two cup holders and it acts as a recliner. If I didn\'t know any better, I\'d think this was an IMAX theater seat. It surely feels luxurious, and my child isn\'t complaining about being strapped in.The only drawback would be that this is bigger and bulkier, but at 25lbs, it\'s actually the same weight as an infant car seat.'}, {'header': 'The only car seat you will need!', 'body': 'This is such a great seat.

It goes from a rear-facing harness (5–40 lbs.) to forward-facing harness (25–65 lbs.) to booster (40–100 lbs.) This adjusts and gives plenty of leg room which means they can stay rear facing longer. The frame is steel reinforced which means it really is the only seat your kids needs. This sear is also made with 0 chemicals which is a huge bonus when your a new mom. I like the ""SuperCinch"" this has. It allows you to get the seat as tight as possible which is super important! The seat I got is gray but is definitely gender neutral. It has been great and I wouldn\'t want anything else!'}, {'header': 'Did not find any drawbacks', 'body': 'I absolutely adore this car seat. First of all, it is well-cushioned. Not too puffy ( like Evenflo), so the newborn will not be squished all over and sweaty.

First of all, it has nine recline positions to adjust which is better than the 6-position that we had before. The cushion is quite comfortable and my daughter loves sitting on it. More importantly (Fig. 6), the shape of the back-support cushion is a triangle which is super nice since I always worried about the spine support when used for a baby in the rear-facing position.I used to suffer placing two car seats next to each other in the rear passenger seat because the cup holder took too much space. The design of the cup holder for this product offers a great solution. Now the rear passenger seat could fit two car seats plus a vacant seat for an adult. We really love it.'}, {'header': 'Amazing!', 'body': ""This is such a great car seat! We got it because my son had outgrown his rear facing infant seat. This chair is fantastic! He is so comfortable with it in the front facing position. I hear zero complaints about comfort. It was easy enough to install. The seat itself is very padded and looks comfortable. I like that you can adjust the tightness on the straps while he is in the chair. The cupholders are a fun and convenient touch. I wish I had just bought one of these originally because you can use it rear facing as well as a booster.

I expected it to be nice but am completely amazed with how it was truly designed around safety as a first priority and comfort a second to make it perfect to ease a parents’ mind AND give children the comfort they deserve.The SENSORSAFE buckle is something I have never seen before and I have raised many children. I am so impressed that the technology we have these days is now being integrated into one of the most important things possible- keeping children safe. The Bluetooth feature allows you to receive notifications on your device even when your child is in the care of someone else. If the person caring for your child leaves that child buckled in and gets more than 25 feet from the vehicle or the temperature inside the vehicle gets too high you’ll receive a notification that they may be in trouble. If the alert isn’t answered in a timely manner then it will automatically begin notifying emergency contacts (who don’t even need to have the app installed- it will call them directly). There are also many other options including being alerted when it is unbuckled and time seated.I love the SENSORSAFE buckle but what I love even more is the “ratchet strap” system for securing to the anchors in the vehicle.

A few quick turns of the lever and you are good to go.It comes with machine washable, very easy to remove (and just as easy to reattach) covers. They are very soft and plush to make a comfy ride. The cup holders are very stable and one side even comes with a nice rubber insert which the child can hold a few small snacks.This is truly a life changer. The BEST car seat I have ever used and surely will never go back.

It’s my first Evenflo seat, but the quality is similar to my Grace seats which I like a lot. It’s attractive, easy to clean, and has great safety features. At first the sensor clip seemed a little gimmicky to me, but after using it for a bit I do have very positive feelings about it. The sensor, per the manual, is designed to alert you when baby is left in the car seat, if the temperature is too hot or too cold, if chest is left unbuckled, or if baby needs a break from being in the seat. At first I thought these are all issues I wouldn’t have. Then it hit me- no one would do any of these things on purpose & yet they happen all the time. It’s nice to have the added peace of mind. I haven’t had any issues with the app malfunctioning or giving false alarms so far, I’m happy to report. Installation was easy as a rear facing.Another great feature of having the app is that you have your manuals at hand. It’s so frustrating to not have them when you need them so I’m loving that features.I hope you found this review helpful!'}, {'header': 'The carseat of all carseats', 'body': ""Let me start by saying that this car seat is AMAZING!!!! There is absolutely nothing that I can ever say negative about it. It's the ONLY car seat that you'll ever purchase from newborn to 10. It transforms ever so smoothly and is jampacked with new features.The carseat has a sensor that alerts you if baby is left in the car, if the temperature of the vehicle's interior is too low or high, it even alerts you if baby unbuckles themselves while you're driving all through a free downloaded app. It even weighs baby to indicate the recommended seat position (forward or rear facing). It reclines which is especially helpful for when baby is taking a nap while riding.My favorite feature is that you can actually adjust the straps while baby is still IN the seat which makes for a more accurate measurement. This is way more expensive in other places so you really save with this seller.It was fairly easy to install and quickly uninstalls.""}, {'header': 'Great car seat!', 'body': 'Evenflo makes great baby/kid products! This car seat will last a long time and is super easy to set up. The seat is cushy and is great for all seasons. I love that you can take the seat cover off to wash it to keep it clean. I like that the straps are super adjustable for growing kids. The sensor safe feature is an awesome feature, I like that tells you the temp of the car, if the clip falls out and that I have the manuals all on the app! I think its a great car seat.'}, {'header': 'Amazing Smart Seat!', 'body': ""My grandbaby is growing out of his rear facing car seat so I ordered this Evenflo as a step up. This is the Cadillac of car seats, I'm super impressed. Very easy to correctly, and safely, install in your car, and the Evenflo SensorSafe app was also easy to find in the Google Play store. The app is very user friendly. You can even have more than one SensorSafe car seat connected to your phone. You can name each car seat so you know which of your little escape artists may have unbuckled themselves. I'm very curious to see how the sensors react to our extreme desert heat, where car interiors can get up to 140 degrees out in the sun. If we have an issue this summer, I will update my review.Although new parents may be tempted to purchase this all in one car seat, I do recommend an infant seat with a base and a travel system/stroller at first. It's just so much easier with an infant to just move them in their seats straight to a stroller. Especially in hot climates, when you don't want your infant seat sitting in the car baking in the heat. When they are ready to move up to front facing, definitely consider this seat from Evenflo.""}, {'header': 'Easy to clean, a great seat...', 'body': ""This is a great car seat from Evenflo for a number of practical reasons. It's low on the gadgetry score (excluding the SensorSafe chest clip which is kind of cool even if it is a gadget), low on the pointless expensive materials score and high on practical utility.For instance:1) The seat cover comes off exceptionally easily by means of velcro and zippers so that it can be washed. This is a great feature any parent with experience trying to clean filthy car seats will love.2) The car seat grows with your child. It can handle a 4-pound infant, but it grows from a rear-facing seat for babies and small children to a front-facing seat for growing toddlers, to a high-backed booster seat for bigger children and a low booster seat for children who need only a slight boost in height--holding up to 120 pounds maximum weight.3) The latch system (EasyClick is Evenflo's name for it) is easy to tighten and incredibly secure.4) Materials are sturdy. Nice cupholders. Just a fine design in every respect.Now, the one kind of gizmo-ish feature is the sensor chest strap which attaches via radio to a car dongle and warns when the car is on and the chest strap is unlatched, when the car is off and the chest strap is still on, and through your phone warns of high heat (95-degrees and over) or when temperature falls below 45 degrees. The SensorSafe chest strap requires a dongle permanently left in the OBD2 port of your car, not a real hassle at all unless you want to run diagnostic tests, in which case you only have to pull out the dongle temporarily.This is a winner of a car seat. It's got a lot of good with not a lot of fluff.""}, {'header': 'Very solid car seat', 'body': 'Very comfortable and solid car seat. The installation process was quite easy and quick.My toddler seems to like it, however it feels almost overly cushioned. The car seat itself is pretty heavy, if you are petite, you may need help lifting it.Occasionally my daughter gets too sweaty while in it, due to all the padding.Other than that, two cup holders are great. The fabric is easy to clean, and her little messes are not very noticeable. The seat harnesses are comfortable and do not bother her chunky legs. So far, so good.'}, {'header': 'Super Cool Car Seat', 'body': 'I like how kids of different stages can fit into this car seat, which is especially helpful for new parents!!It’s not difficult to install and it fits our SUV perfectly.

The sensor-safe feature is a real bonus— this thing is high tech! I think the most beneficial of the alerts are the chest unbuckling one.

The pillow easily removes when no longer needed. Once in forward-facing mode, the Continuum keeps your child safer in the harness up to 50 pounds. When your child is ready to transition to vehicle seat belts, simply remove the harness to use the Continuum 3-in-1 Car Seat in belt-positioning booster mode all the way up to 80 pounds.In both rear-facing and forward-facing mode, harness holders keep the harness in an open position. This makes it easier for you to get your child in and out of the car seat. No more fishing for the harness and clips from behind your child  theyre right there when you need them. The QuickFit Harness offers additional convenience in both of these stages by letting you adjust the height of both the headrest and harness in one quick and easy step, making it simple to give your growing child the best fit. In booster mode, the headrest still adjusts easily on its own so that you can continue to get the best fit for your child.The Continuum is simple to clean with a machine washable and dryer safe cover that removes easily from the seat. The pad attaches to the seat with snaps so theres no need to remove the harness or disassemble the car seat. Just unsnap and lift the pad away to put it in the machine. The cup holder is also designed to be easy to clean. Just twist it out and put it into the dishwasher to get rid of the goopy buildup that ends up in every kids cup holder.The Continuum is designed to provide more comfort to you and your other adult passengers too. It takes up less room when placed rear-facing, giving up to 7 inches more leg room for grownups in the front seat.

I just suggest that they be renamed and marketed differently so it is not so misleading. I have a huge SUV so I can imagine if someone with a smaller vehicle was looking for a smaller car seat this one could be misleading. Love the safety features, comfort, durable fabric. I decided on black because it is easier to see any crumbs or other small bits that fall on the seats, easier to see spots that needed cleaning and impossible to stain so they look sharp all the time.

We do have a third row, but its non usable with two car seats in the middle row as you have to take out the baby\'s car seat as the bottom latch is in the way of the seat moving up. That being said, we needed a big girl car seat when her sister was born as our eldest daughter\'s old one was taking up nearly the whole backseat.When I saw the Graco Slimfit, I knew it would be perfect for both our daughter, and my Nissan Pathfinder. When it came in, my daughter went crazy wanting to sit in it immediately. I did let my husband put it in the vehicle as it is still a bit hefty even being the slim fit version. I did watch him, and he had strapped in the vehicle in less than ten minutes, and that includes taking out our old car seat protection mat, and wiping it down first. It went in so much easier I swear than a regular infant car seat! With a few snaps, and tugs, he had it ready to go! And let me say that before he put this in, my daughter did sit down so I could measure the straps, and make sure everything was where it needed to go. With this car seat, it has easy press buttons on the sides of the headrest that easily allows you to slide it up or down (yay!), to fit your child better. Once we had everything adjusted correctly, he strapped it in, and we were ready to go! Yes, I did have to do a mini drive around the yard as she wanted to ""test it out."" Her words.So is this Graco car seat really a slim fit? Yes!!! I was able to put my other daughter\'s infant seat right in the middle with her sister\'s new car seat on the side of her. And guess what? I have another, perfectly open seat next to the baby! Whoot whoot! There was no way I was getting two car seats side by side with the older model we had, but with the slim fit, we were able to put them together safely, and still have an extra seat open on the side since we can\'t use the third row (her infant car seat is just an inch on the other seats side preventing it from laying down so someone could get in the back, FYI). As for my eldest daughter, I feel she is secure every time I put her in it. Graco has hands down the best, and most reasonably priced car seats that really feel like you are making a good choice for your children. We\'ve been using this car seat for a long while now, and we\'ve had no issues with long distances, or of her being uncomfortable. I love the headrest design as on the old models her little head would flop, but on this one, it keeps her head steady. The cushion is top notch, and I love the sippy cup holders as they are super easy to clean, which is a must when it comes to kids! I\'m already measuring for another one of these slim fit car seats for my youngest daughter when she gets a little older.'}, {'header': 'From 5-100lbs, the only car seat you need for 10 years!', 'body': ""When our oldest was born, I'm not sure 3-in-1 car seats like this even existed. In hindsight, we now wish we had invested in something like this. This car seat can be used for rear-facing plus forward facing with the harness and forward facing as a booster seat.Currently we chose to use this in the booster seat mode so we could pass down our older Britax to our youngest who is still rear-facing. (Our Britax does not have a booster seat mode)This Graco Slimfit is well designed and the instructions were easy to follow to convert to booster-seat-mode. I read everything 3x and checked everything all over again. It was easy to store the on-seat-harness so that the car's seatbelt could be used. I had my oldest test this several times and the Graco held the shoulder portion of the car's seatbelt perfectly. It was easy to adjust the head/torso portion up and down to ensure the shoulder belt aligned to the correct location. And then I re-checked everything with the manual again. :-DI had my youngest (24lbs) also sit in this when I unboxed everything on the living room floor. The harness was easy to adjust and tighten and pressing the buckle button actually released the belt latches on the first try. (Other brands, Britax, Diono and Maxi-Cosi included, you have to press the release-button repeatedly and fully to unlatch everything)I *think* I like the self-tensioning latch setup, which I am using to keep the booster seat in place and to prevent it from flying around, which the instructions specifically says you can do, which I absolutely appreciate!! This is a huge PLUS, because other brands have no latch and no provisions to keep the booster seat in place, so it just flies around when empty; Graco did this right!The reason I say I think I like the self-tensioning LATCH system is because our old-school Britax, I use my knee/body weight and arm-strength to pull the latch belt so that the car seat absolutely will not move forwards, backwards or side to side and that's what we really like about our old Britax. The Graco will still be pulled snug, but you have to press the tensioner button, versus doing this the old-fashioned way. The tensioner-reel is also a potential point of failure, whereby the old-school Britax way is the same standard seat-belt concept in use for decades where I haven't heard of any trends of failures.The rotating cup holders is a pretty cool design and actually helps with cleaning and getting crumbs out easier, though you'll probably just leave them as dual cup-holders forever.This is a well-designed car seat with the future in mind. Literally, you can use it from 5-100lbs and all car seats have a Federal expiration of 10 years.Graco designed this well, the instructions were easy to follow, the adjustments were easy to make and I appreciate the fact there's in-seat-storage for the instruction manual for potential middle-child usage when the oldest grows out of it.This is an easy 5-star choice that I wish we had started out with for our first-born.""}, {'header': 'Great seat, super easy to install!', 'body': ""We have the GRACO SLIMFIT 3-IN-1 CONVERTIBLE CAR SEAT, ANNABELLE for my husband's truck (Silverado) for our 13 month old. We have a new baby due in a few months and needed another seat for her (I drop the kids off at the sitter's and hubby picks them up in the afternoon because he gets off before I do).I got excited when I saw that they had a Slimfit version to match the 4Ever we got for my vehicle. I've included a ton of pics, one is a side by side of the Slimfit next to the 4ever. One is a side by side of the Slimfit platinum next to our current Slimfit (the purple one).The last pictures I've included are the ones that my husband is the most excited about. Apparently the platinum edition comes with an EZ Tight Latch system, while our older regular model came with the Inright Latch System (the one that looks like a regular buckle). My husband said this new one is going to be so much easier to take in and out of his truck. He often has to remove our son's car seat during the day and either put it in the truck bed or leave it at the shop while he's working if he has to fit other guys in his truck for the day. He says he's strongly contemplating getting another platinum one so that they will both be easy to remove and reinstall.While I don't really see the Slimfit as being that much smaller than the 4ever carseat, my husband says he definitely notices a difference versus how the 4ever fits in my Tahoe.""}, {'header': 'Another Winner from Graco', 'body': ""We needed an extra car seat for my mother-in-law's car, when she's bringing our Daughter somewhere (someplace that involves lots of sugary things). The idea of a slimmer car seat was appealing, although the actual application of it is a bit odd in this model. You rotate the cup holders away, and its supposed to conserve space. It's not really noticeable.That aside, there's much to like about this car seat. The EZ Tight LATCH feature is pretty cool and useful. There are three different positions that the seat can be used in, so you can actually hang on to it until your child is about 100 pounds or so. The height of the harness and headrest can be adjusted, which is simple to do and very convenient. And the seat was engineered to keep your child safe in the event of a side-impact. So hopefully, none of us parents will ever have to actually test that feature out. Graco is a name we know and trust, and this is definitely another five-star car seat by them.""}, {'header': 'Well Built 3-in-1 Seat', 'body': ""Our family has used several Graco car seats in the past that have always been reliable and convenient to use, and this model was no exception. This 3-in-1 car seat will keep you little one safe as they transition from newborn to toddler to later childhood. It functions as a rear-facing seat for an infant, a front facing seat with harness, and lastly as a booster seat that can be used with your car's seat belt. The seat will support your newborn baby all the way from just 5 lbs until they're an older child of 100 lbs. It's easy to install and move between different cars thanks to they simple to use latch clips. At this stage we've only used the infant car seat so far. The infant seat is comfortable for the baby but also provides plenty of cushioning around the head in case of an accident. The seat also reclines to several different positions to suit your baby's needs. The seat claims that it's 10% slimmer than other seats, but I don't really notice any difference as far as I can tell. Overall this is a great transitional car seat that appears to be built to last for many years to come.""}, {'header': 'Built To Last', 'body': ""This is a very strong and safe car seat. I am surprised to see that it is currently unavailable. Perhaps Amazon is just out of stock at the moment though?In any event, it was an excellent deal at the time I ordered it and it is still going strong. I like the fact that it will last up to 10 years without having to keep upgrading to new seats. I also like the fact that they are actually built tough enough to last for that long.I think that the selling point of this seat being slimmer is a bit silly, since all they are really doing is making the cup holder swivel inwards in order to make it take up less space. It doesn't really have much practical purpose. It would be easier to just buy a car seat without a cup holder if you really need the space.Bottom line is, cup holder or not, this seat is a good value and a very decent product that stacks up well against competitors.""}, {'header': 'Feels like quality', 'body': ""Graco is the Honda of car seats. It's not a posh brand. It's not going to impress anyone. It is reliable, well engineered, and when simple, understandably so. I appreciate the slick way this seat looks, the generous thick padding everywhere, and the general sense of structure and safety.The EZ Latch concept is practical. It's easy to get this seat safely secured to your car's seat. It's just well engineered. Removing the fabric was also pretty easy, and it washes very well and looks fresh and new afterwards.Like the other reviewer, I was kinda chuckle at the 'slim' aspect. This is a big carseat, and the cup holders moving around is not really that necessary. But they will probably hold up for a few years. If you're really in need of a slim seat, this isn't the slimmest, but it's a great seat that is safe, easy to use, and easy to keep looking clean.""}, {'header': 'Secure and grows with your child', 'body': 'My niece recently had a baby and she uses this in her truck. Firstly she loves how easy it was to install. She especially likes how slim it is. She had a small infant weighing just under six pounds. He fit in this and was secure. This is so easy to latch into the vehicle and she says it feels so secure. He does not bounce around and the seat carrier is totally locked in place. This is rear facing so it is safe and there is lots of cushion around the baby. She likes that this seat will grow with her son and she absolutely likes that it is not too wide either because she plans on having other children and having a narrower seat makes it easy for multiple car seats to fit in the truck.'}, {'header': 'For your future rocket scientist', 'body': 'Definitely secure but a tad intimidating. Pretty much every member of my family (all of us with college degrees) has had a ""WTH(eck)?"" moment when looking at this thing. No, it doesn\'t actually take a doctorate to use it, it just looks like it does. The upside of all those instruction stickers is that my 4 yr old, who like myself, started reading on her own at 2 1/2, has something to peruse while waiting for us to load up the car. Perhaps she\'ll be the one to actually become a rocket scientist in the family.That said, it\'s sturdy and safe and will last through at least a couple of kids, be they mine or my sister\'s, and Graco is a trusted name in our household. No, it does not come with a purple gorilla, sorry.'}, {'header': 'Works well for our 3 year old', 'body': ""I recently installed this Slimfit platinum in my 2019 Honda Pilot for my 3 year old daughter. It came well packaged and it was simple to use. The car seat is decently light weight and slim, but my car doesn't have issues with space so I cant really comment on that. If you are familiar with Graco car seats, there are no surprises here. This is basically like my other one used in another car. You can change the recline angle, the back height easily. We use the LATCH system and had to move the belt since it comes from the factory for rear facing. The switch was simple, but if you've never done it before, just read the manual. All the pads can come out and be washed. This is a good car seat at a decent price. We really like it.""}, {'header': 'Slim seat still fits the child', 'body': 'This seat was gotten to replace an older model whose safe use date expired. The user is barely four, and this new seat will see service for about five more years. It is promoted as a slimmer model, without cramping the sitter. Since the back seat always needs two car seats in place, and sometimes a third for a cousin, even minor narrowness sounds attractive. Upon unpacking, the new seat meets the need. It is a good fit without pinxhing, and the child is happy with it.'}, {'header': 'The Best ! !', 'body': 'This is seriously the best seat that we have gotten, yet! From the beginning of unpacking out of the box, to installing. It is absolutely well built and very sturdy. The connections from the seat to the car harnesses are very easy to use. The buckle to strap a child in are sturdy and easy to use. I truly highly recommend this seat, you will not be disappointed.'}, {'header': 'Safe and so simple to install', 'body': 'This is the best car seat. It was easy to install and has several safety precautions that I really appreciate. It’s also a great car seat for a baby that must still be rear facing but is larger than a typical infant size car seat. I can tell that my little baby is significantly more comfortable in this car seat then his previous infant car seat that was getting too small.'}, {'header': 'Terrific', 'body': ""The Graco Slimfit Platinum 3-in-1 Car Seat is a great product.- Versatility - this car seat can be rear-facing, forward-facing, a highback booster seat, and a backless booster seat.

But compared to a Chicco Next Fit I had in the past, that installation was effortless, this Gracco sit does require some work to install properly and safely.The rebound bar and extension for the legs is a great addition for safety and comfort. But there\'s a little issue, in order to be able to use the 5"" extension panel for the legs, you need to have a pretty big car, and if not, the front sit passenger will not be able to be used. When the car seat is installed rear facing, the sit cannot touch the front seat (look a the manual or look online if you doubt about this). I installed the sit in my Toyota Highlander 2015 and with the 5"" panel extension my front sit is very close to the dash of the car. I\'m only 5 feet tall, not too big, so I can sit there, but a bigger person will not fit. I tried to install the sit in a Toyota Corolla 2020, rear facing with the extension panel and it just doesn\'t fit no matter how much I moved the sit close to the dash. So keep that in mind while considering this seat.Another thing I loved about this sit is the fit. It\'s truly a sit that will be able to be used for the whole time a kid needs a car seat. The fit for newborns is excellent (pictured 19"" babe) it reclines all the way keeping a baby with no body coordination well positioned and the head doesn\'t move to the sides or hangs. For older kids, the sit is wide and very tall, tallest that my Safety First brand sit. I have a 7 year old who is barely fitting in the Safety First seat using the 5 point harness. The belts are a bit bellow her shoulder when they are supposed to be above her shoulders as per the manual recommends (look online about this too, when the child is forward facing the belts needs to be above the shoulder, and when baby is rear facing the belts needs to be bellow the shoulder).So with this sit you will be able to safely use the harness with older kids. My kid is 50, pounds and still has some space to grow and keep using the 5 point harness in this Gracco Sit, but is not able to safely use the harness on the Safety First sit she has, although she hasn\'t meet the weight limit of that sit.I take very seriously the safety of my children and has used several car seat through the years. This car seat convinced me and I can say that is a good one for this price point.As a closure notes; I don\'t think you will be able to fit 3 car seats using this one, is very wide. The harness is a little thigh to pull when the car seat is in the smallest setting. The cup holders detach way too easy and falls a lot, is kind of annoying. It has a compartment to storage the harness when the sit is used as tall back booster what I find super convenient instead of needing to remove the harness. This sit definitely is designed for easy use/transition for different developmental stages of children, just pull the recliner button, pull the head reast up or down, and very easy to use for a newborn, a toddler or a 7 year old.'}, {'header': 'Allows for rear facing for longer', 'body': ""This car seat is really versatile and has three modes, so it can be used from birth, up through 50 pounds. It was pretty simple to set up, and the instruction manual is very clear. I did watch some installation videos as well just to make sure I did everything correctly. I installed this rear facing for my four year old son using the latches in my car. It is very easy to change the headrest and strap height as, well as the recline. There is a clear indicator for the recline so you can make sure it is set properly. There are two cup holders that fit pretty much all of my son's cups. My favorite feature on this car seat is the foot extender, which has a few different levels, and it allows your child to have more leg room while rear facing, so that they can stay rear facing longer since it is considered safer than forward facing. With the extender, my four year old is still able to comfortably rear face. It does push the car seat further out onto the seat of your car, so you do have to make sure it isn't hanging over the edge too much. Once you switch to forward facing, and your child reaches the height requirement, the car seat can be used with a regular seat belt as opposed to the harness and it functions more like a highback booster. A new feature on this particular model is the anti-rebound bar, which is an added safety measure that I am noticing on more and more car seats recently. My only complaint with this seat is that it's pretty bulky and heavy, so it doesn't make for the best travel seat, but it feels very sturdy. Overall, this seat is safe, comfortable, easy to install and allows your child to rear face for longer.""}, {'header': 'Excellent choice for extended rear facing!', 'body': ""This car seat is really great for extended rear facing. I like to keep my kiddos rear facing as long as possible - I don't flip them until age 4 (mine are small so they don't max out the seat before then). With the extended pull-out panel, kiddos have even more leg room to rear face longer.PROS:- Pull-out panel gives kids more leg room to rear-face comfortably- Very easy to install and get a good, tight installation- Anti-rebound bar is a great advanced safety feature and easy to use- Latch system is easy to use- Seat has very clearly marked belt paths and level indicators on the actual seat (rather than having to study the manual every time you move it) that makes it easier to get a correct installation- Covers are easy to clean- No re-thread harness adjustments makes adjusting harness height easyCONS:- While the pull-out leg room panel is an excellent feature, it does take away leg room space for the passenger in the front seat. We have to have it installed on the passenger side, as it is too long for the driver's seat to be at the correct setting for a taller driver. We have the front passenger seat set pretty far up to fit it.""}, {'header': 'Graco Extend2Fit 3 in 1 Car Seat', 'body': 'Got this for my 11 month old since it’s just about time to switch out of her infant car seat. She’s dear facing, and 19 lbs so I cannot comment on forward facing in this seat.Install was a breeze and only took a few minutes. The manual is very straightforward and gives you every thing you need to know.It feels well padded and comfortable, and has more space than her infant seat so I think she’s more comfortable now.Her last seat (maxicosi) constantly had an issue where the straps would become uneven. Almost every single use. I’d have to pull them all the way out, and tighten them multiple times before they would stay even on both sides.Thankfully I haven’t had that issue on this one at all. The straps adjust easily and evenly.I did need to adjust the shoulder strap height but it was done in seconds.Cup holders were a bit of a pain to install and get them to “snap” into place. They’re labeled left and right, but they just didn’t seem to want to go in easily. Once they were in, they seem sturdy and haven’t come back off since.It has little pockets on each side to tuck the harness into so they’re out of the way while you’re getting baby in. I’m short so it’s a bit difficult to reach that high up and over to get the other side but just having one is still really helpful for me.Overall I’m really happy with it. I think the price is really great considering how much use you can get out of it. Our son’s seat only rear faces until 40 lbs and he was 35 lbs at 2 years old so knowing I can rear face so much longer with this one is a huge relief. It’s important to note though that car seats do expire, and this one has an expiration date of 10 years.'}, {'header': 'Great seat', 'body': 'I love that this seat fits up to 50 pounds.

I dont have anything else to compare this to, but I would buy a second one of these when the time comes!'}, {'header': 'Seems Roomy, Safe, and Comfortable for my baby', 'body': ""My husband installed this car seat using the belt harness option. But doing so, it tilts the car seat slightly. However, it is a minor annoyance and my baby doesn't seem to know any difference nor does it seem to care. Every time we put it in the car seat it seems so comfortable and happy, and not to mention, sleeps easily. I have a Nuna Exec in my car and there are some stark differences in terms of materials used, but I have to say that this car seat has some better design options and is wider which is good for my baby since it is a big baby for it's age. I also like the fact that the anti rebound bar extends outward to allow for more leg room and also so my baby can ride rear facing longer. My Nuna Exec doesn't have this feature and my baby who is over the 50th percentile for it's height will eventually experience cramped leg room. Also, the seat belt holders are so much better than the magnetized one of my Nuna which is really placed at a bad position on the side of the seat and the magnets aren't as strong which renders this particular feature useless. Buckling baby in this seat is also much easier as far as tightening goes compared to Nuna. My husband likes this seat for our baby in his car a lot. I still like my $800 Nuna, but this seat has so many more Pro's that it makes it worth getting. I obviously have not tested the other features yet since my baby is still an infant, but I like the idea that this seat will grow with my baby.

Okay, it has been a while ago. 8 years already.

I bought it one month before my expected delivery date. Currently, it is still in use.This is the third Graco car seat we have. This is for the new family member just born 3 days ago. I am so glad we made it on time for the baby girl. She arrived 2 weeks before the expected delivery date.Graco always make the comfortable and safe car seats for kids. I had the Graco extended 2 in 1 for my 1 year old, and it can be used until my little one is 65lbs. This 3 in 1 is even more amazing, until 100lbs.As always, Graco's carseats are always super sturdy!

There's a lot of on-product instructions that I always appreciate. The left side is in English, and the right side in Spanish.The car seat itself is very feature rich. It has a lot of adjustments, that once you know where they are, are fairly easy to adjust. The main tightening adjustment has a release lever that's a metal clasp that you have to reach in quite a bit to get at; other models I've seen make this easier to reach, but also easy for the kiddo to mess with too.The upholstery snaps off (with some force) for easy washing, which is a nice feature. The cup holders are installed when you receive it, but I don't see an easy way to remove them (I can't get at the plastic snaps that locked it in) - I don't see the point in having the user install these if they're not removeable, and don't impact the overall size of the chair.I'm not a big fan of Graco. I have several products from them, ranging from Pack'n'Plays and Carriers, to another model of car seat that I generally have major gripes with. This car seat, however, I don't see any major flaws.

He is one yr old, just turned, so he is much heavier and this carseat makes it so much easier to get in and out of my pathfinder. And when he doesn't want to be in the carseat and is upset while I try buckling him, having him facing me while buckling him in is also much easier than struggling sideways. The height of this carseat is also very nice because my child is tall. He is also a chunky monkey lol so he has plenty of room but it's also not as wide as other carseats either so it doesn't take up the middle seat like other seats do that have wider bottoms. This one fits him perfectly without being wide or too thin. The head rest really fits around his head nicely too. He just looks so comfortable and relaxing like when he is in it it makes me want to try it lol. Super expensive but I think it's totally worth it. The way you use the belts and stuff to put it in the car itself is super easy too. Way easier than using the latch system, which I do love, and just as tight as if u were using the latch. Directions are simple to understand.""}, {'header': 'Tried 5 different seats… the BEST!', 'body': 'I’ve tested the Evenflo Gold revolve360, the Evenflo Everyfit, the Graco convertible slim, and the Graco Extend-to-fit. A few things that were important to me:Ease of install! I installed this car seat on my own in about 2 minutes or less. Connected the Rear anchors and then pressed down on the rapid lock—this feature is AMAZING. Ever feel like you can’t pull the strap tight enough to feel like your seat is secure? The rapid lock feature solves this issue by adding pressure to your strap to make it even tighter. Say goodbye to putting all your weight on your seat to secure your car seat!!Size—this seat has the smallest profile out of all 5 rear facing seats I’ve tested. Great for extra leg room!Of course, the spin feature is great. I will say it’s latch is a much more convenient design than the evenflo spin latch design.Straps are easy to adjust as well.Pricey, but worth it.

I wish I had this earlier because it makes it so convenient. We had a Dr. Appointment in the car one day and it made it easy for that as well. It was easy to install with the anchors to have them rear facing. In addition, it has an easy pass system for your seatbelt if you do not have anchors or if you are facing the car seat forward. This has been one of the best products I've bought since having my daughter.""}, {'header': 'Sturdy, Comfortable And Thoughtfully Designed', 'body': ""We’ve been through a lot of car seats over the years, and overall this is definitely one of the best infant/baby/toddler seats we’ve seen. Both the base and the seat are well-designed and well-made. They give you a great deal of confidence that your little passenger will be protected in the unfortunate event of an accident.The level of protection this seat looks like it would provide is impressive. The high back and sides of the seat basically envelop the infant/baby in a protective cocoon. So it really does seem like it would provide a lot of protection in any type of accident/crash.Protection aspects aside, this seat is also well-padded and comfortable. We have had issues with thinly padded car seats in the past, as they do become really uncomfortable for anything other than short trips around town.Of course, our favorite thing about this particular seat is that it swivels. The seat will swivel 90 degrees to the right or the left, which is A LOT of help when you are moving your baby in and out of the seat. And it is even more helpful when you are loading and unloading a toddler or a small child. So we are very impressed and pleased with this seat’s thoughtful design/functionality.If you’re looking for a new car seat, I think this one is a rock solid choice. There’s a lot to like about it, and I really can’t think of anything negative that I need to point out. So, if you can make peace with the somewhat hefty price tag, I am confident that you will be happy with this car seat.If you have any questions about this Baby Jogger car seat, please feel free to ask, and I'll try my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.""}, {'header': 'Much heavier than I anticipated but otherwise awesome', 'body': ""I don't haul kids often but when I do I want it to be as easy and safe as possible. This seemed a great option, and so far it has been. This style of seat is seemingly becoming the go-to and most desired, so I figured sure, lets give it a shot. Seems very quality, well-built, sturdy, etc. Is certainly large and cumbersome though, if I were pressed for a complaint, so I wouldn't really plan on being able to move this from vehicle-to-vehicle on a regular basis (maybe ever). If you are a multi-vehicle family and are considering this, I would probably recommend budgeting for two of these. No use having your kid(s) super safe in one vehicle only to take less caution in the other.""}, {'header': 'What a perfect car seat!', 'body': ""I love Baby Jogger single and double strollers. When I saw this car seat I instantly knew I needed this for my son.It starts off looking like just a slightly taller car seat for new born to front facing car seat. The thing that sold me on this seat was the swivel to get your child in and out of the car seat. It works on both sides of the car and locks firmly. I am very impressed in this technology especially for smaller cars.The one down side is it doesn't swivel when front facing. Besides that I really.like the car seat and my son really likes it too.""}, {'header': 'Very nice car seat', 'body': ""This Baby Jogger car seat is the first car seat of this brand that I have reviewed. It is a substantial seat that reminds me a bit of the Chicco, Maxi Cosi, and Britax seats I have used in the past.This is the first seat that I have used where the seat can swivel a rear facing child toward the door for easier loading and unloading. I find this feature to be intriguing, but I also suspect that if a recall were to happen on this seat in the future, my best guess would be that this novelty feature will probably be the problem. I see potential for the seat to not fully lock into the rear facing position after being swiveled.The seat is generously padded and the head rest of the seat is easy to adjust. The shoulder pads on the harness have a grippy material on the interior and the back side of the pads. I don't like the textured material on the back of the seat pads because I see it as an issue during the summer months where a child may be wearing a tank top or sundress. I wouldn't want the grippy material on my baby's skin on a hot day. It is probably the feature that I like the least on this car seat.Installation for this seat is pretty easy. For the rear facing seat, there is a built in lock off in the base of the seat that allows you to get a secure installation. For forward facing installation, I find it is best if you fully extend the head rest so you have ample room to maneuver the seat belt or LATCH belt through the pathway.Overall, it's a nice seat. It seems to be very good quality and attention to detail is evident in the design.""}, {'header': 'Very easy to install and use', 'body': ""This car seat is beautiful! It is fairly heavy compared to other car seats but since this will be used in one vehicle, it's not to much of an issue but it was heavy to lift up into my vehicle. It's very easy to secure with the teether strap. There is a rapid lock feature that you can use in older vehicles that makes sure the seatbelt is secured correctly. The swivel is nice for getting baby in and out of car, especially if you don't have a roomy vehicle. This car seat has a lot of features! There is a lot of padding making it very comfy, the headrest can be pulled up from the top to extend it more which is great for tall toddlers! It will definitely grow with your child. This is a pricey car seat but it will be the only one you need. I feel it is well worth it.""}, {'header': 'Very nice', 'body': 'This is a very nice and sturdy car seat that grows with the baby. From first glance out of the box I noticed how sturdy and nice it is. Very well made with lots of protection for the baby. Baby fit perfectly. No problems.

Highly recommended.'}, {'header': 'Rotating Feature is Awesome!', 'body': 'Absolutely beautiful, high-end car seat. The rotate feature alone is enough to make anyone say ""why don\'t all car seats have this?"". It makes putting baby in and baby out of the car a breeze.Easy to install with the ""pivot feature"" which makes sure the seat is angled correctly for your car.Material is easy to wipe clean and having a snack cup holder keeps messes at bay.Would definitely recommend this car seat to any new parent! 5 Stars all the way!'}, {'header': 'Amazing easy to use car seat', 'body': ""The is a fantastic car seat! We upgraded when our 16 month old was to big to fit in his first car seat.Installation was very easy with the included directions.

The seat belt then snaps into the correct place.The rotate feature for putting your child in is a game changer! So much easier when child is facing you to get him into the seat.The included cup holder is a nice feature for drinks and snacks. Everything cleans fairly easily.Only downside, which has nothing to do with car seat is we have an Audi Q5 and it is very tight in back with this rear facing. The front passenger seat is uncomfortably far forward to make this fit with leg room for child.""}, {'header': 'Impressive car seat', 'body': 'This Convertible car seat is very convenient for getting your child in and out of the back seat. The weight of this car seat is heavy, so be aware if you traveling and need to bring the car seat around with you. The material of this seat is very high quality and comfortable for my toddler. The swivel back seat is very convenient. We like the quality of this car seat very much. The materials are all made up of high-grade polyester and it would be easy to clean when it gets dirty.'}, {'header': 'Very impressed', 'body': ""This is really the most luxurious car seat I've ever seen! My older ones had nice car seats but they don't even compare to this one, the little one is a lucky guy! It's super padded and the material is so smooth. He looks so comfy and safe in there. The swivel feature is what really drew me to this. I have a giant SUV and climbing up and over him to get him in and out is such a pain. This seat easily turns in either direction and then snaps back into the forward position. He thinks it's cool when I turn him too. It comes with an insert for infants and it can be used backward facing as well. The headrest can be pulled up about a foot, so I'm sure this will last into the toddler years as well. I think this will be the only car seat you'll ever need. My older kids had three for their different stages. It is a heavy, bulky thing so it's not fun to move between cars, but I think that's what makes it so safe and secure and durable. The price is definitely justified for this seat and after seeing and using so many others, I don't think you'll find a better one.""}, {'header': 'Did not find any drawbacks', 'body': 'Baby Jogger City Turn Convertible car seat turned out to be really good in my opinion. I have two kids, youngest is a 1-year-old girl, very picky. Yet,she likes this car seat a lot, eagerly gets in and out. The cup holder is good to have. The width is generous, not too narrow ( as Diono). It is very soft and plush, also easy to clean. The installation process was very quick. Not sure if it is worth the price tag, but in terms of comfort it is great.'}, {'header': 'LOVE THIS CARSEAT!', 'body': ""This was a secondary car seat to go in my Husbands truck, while I had the car seat that works with the travel system and stroller in my jeep.

My grandson laughs because it is different than his car seat. I do believe he thinks it’s a special ride!We have four grandchildren. Three of them are rear facing, so this one is for them when they are with us . Again, one hand adjustment for the straps so it’s easy for us to adjust depending on which grandchild we have.

If you're upgrading from a one baby stroller to a twin stroller please remember It's bigger than the picture shows. It's like trying to maneuver a train or a bus It's just very big so if you can handle a bigger item definitely get this I think it's worth it. I have a 2015 Chevrolet Equinox so the trunk isn't massive But still I expected the stroller to fit and without me having to fight with it everyday. However I give it five stars because for me personally it's coming handy I do have two kids under the age of 6 months so I need it. But besides that I have a daughter requires oxygen so whenever I don't have the other baby with me keeping the oxygen and all the medical equipment in the first seat is really helpful and when I have both of the babies I'll just have the oxygen on my back and have both babies in the stroller.Now for the more negative part of this review The area for the baby bag is definitely not big enough so if the baby bag storage compartment is important to you then you would really like the stroller but if you're looking for a stroller with a compartment that's going to hold a pretty good decent sized baby bag this isn't probably the one for you When I have both the babies in the stroller Putting a baby bag in between the two is just it's nearly impossible. Other than that it's a good buy.

The only drawback is the top anchor goes over the headrest, since the model 3 rear seat headrest is not adjustable and doesn’t have an opening to put the latch through. This is not a fault of the seat. Tesla will most likely address this in its next model update. Easy to install, like most car seats. I just wish they would all use a ratchet type latch tightening system instead of having to sit a full grown adult in the seat to tighten it down enough to where it only has 1/4” of wiggle.

There are noticeable differences between my E2F and the G4M:- The fabric is different material and feel.- Some stitching is different color than fabric.- There are less newborn inserts in the G4M.- The LATCH for the G4M is not the InRight, just standard.- The seat cover for the G4M is held together by a hook and loop setup rather than with snaps.- One cup holder in the G4M instead of two.Bottom line, these differences do not hinder the comfort nor the (most important) safety of the seat and therefore it was a great budget buy!!

Too many people transition their kids out of these safety measures too soon. Regardless of how old your child is, maintaining car seat safety is essential and depends on your child\'s height and weight, in my opinion. When the high back booster became too uncomfortable for my 58 lb 4\'8"" 10yo I began contemplating the no back booster, unfortunately all the no back boosters I looked at slid around the back seat and while they would have lifted my child so that she could appropriately use the in car seat belt, it was actually less safe in keeping her in place. Then I found the Peg Perago Viaggio Shuttle.The major difference between the Peg Perago Viaggio Shuttle and all other no-back boosters are the integrated rigid latch system. These are the two metal arms that anchor the booster to your car. NO OTHER NO BACK BOOSTER HAS THIS. I bought this booster for this reason alone and I was not disappointed. No more sliding around and I have the piece of mind in knowing that my kid is safe in the event of a car accident.As for comfort, my older kid was happy not to have to be restricted to her 90 degree high back booster, so plus there. Unfortunately the seat leaves much to be desired in the way of padding, she says. This wasn\'t enough to deter me from buying this and we will just have her sit on a towel for long drives.I feel like the price is definitely more than comparable boosters but you pay for what you get.I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to others looking for a booster.'}, {'header': 'Expensive but awesome!', 'body': ""I chose this booster seat because it has a rigid latch system.

How do I know this? My five year old granddaughter races out to the car to get on her booster seat, and is always delighted to ride in it.

The materials and construction of this car seat all look and feel top-notch. It's a heavy, sturdy seat with reassuring safety features.I like that this seat allows my child to be in rear-facing mode up to 45lbs. Most car seats have a much lower rear-facing limit. It's really tempting to turn the seat into forward-facing mode as soon as your child reaches the 22lb minimum, but rear-facing mode is MUCH safer, so it's best to keep your child rear-facing as long as possible. Most statistics I have seen claim your child is five times less likely to be seriously injured or killed in rear-facing mode.The rebound bar is an excellent safety feature for rear-facing mode that I highly recommend you use because it helps the seat have a tighter installation and it provides extra protection in the event of a crash. I have another seat with this feature (the Clek Foonf), and the advantage with this Primo Viaggio seat is that the bar simply folds underneath the seat when you switch to forward facing. The rebound bar on the Clek seat has to be detached and stored elsewhere.The one thing that I don't care for so much is the cupholder. It's a little flimsy and it doesn't clip on that securely, plus it's in kind of an awkward position for the child to reach. Considering how well the rest of the seat is designed, the cupholder feels almost like an afterthought. It's not a dealbreaker, but it could be better. I have a Graco Exend2Fit Platinum seat and that has two cupholders built in in a much better position. My Clek Foonf didn't even come with a cupholder and the optional one that you can buy fits much the same as this Primo Viaggio one. Perhaps the side location is safer in the event of a crash so the contents of the cupholder are less likely to hit your child if they fly out.""}, {'header': 'Best of the Best', 'body': ""If you have been searching for the Rolls Royce of baby car seats, look no further. While the Primo Viaggio brand may not exactly be a household name in this country, they have been quietly making some of the highest quality products on the market since 1949.Based in Italy, the company manufactures car seats as well as a number of other innovative child products. Just about all other car seats sold in the U.S. are made in China using the least expensive material available and mass manufactured on an assembly line. This model seems to be practically hand made with a great deal of attention paid to detail and luxury. The safety specs and features go well above the minimum standards required in the U.S. and are the most comprehensive you will find anywhere.The latch system is very simple to use and provides maximum protection. The anti rebound bar and side protection pods are unique safety features that aren't available on any other car seats that I have seen from other manufacturers. This is pretty much the be all end all product when it comes to baby car seats. It definitely comes at a premium price, but if you have that kind of money to spend you will only want the best and this model definitely delivers.""}, {'header': 'This is a great option for a carseat', 'body': ""Out of the box, I was impressed with this car seat. It has great safety features and high-end finishes, such as the leather (synthetic?) outer layer, soft and cushioned seat, and the rebound bar for backward facing kids. My daughter is a small two-year-old and will remain backward facing for an extended period of time. The rebound bar is a safety feature, but also extends the distance from the seat allowing for more leg room.The car seat is easy to install and clips right into my 2018 Highlander's second-row captain seat. It is on the larger size but fits perfectly in the singular seat. The harness clips in securely and my kids can both clip themselves, but require help to release. The harness tightens easily with the pull and releases with the tab. I've hard to rethread a couple of times in as many months due to the threads being twisted. It was easy enough and did not require me to remove the car seat and flip it over as I have had to do with other brands. The seat is padded and feels nice and comfortable. Most importantly it securely latches and I feel that my daughter is safe when riding in this seat. I would definitely repurchase this seat and recommend it to my family.""}, {'header': 'Excellent seat', 'body': 'This is a gorgeous, well made car seat with lots of safety features. Its not one you will want to be switching in and out if vehicles, so make sure it fits with your needs, as well as in your vehicle. I think an SUV is better suited for it if you plan to use the extender bar. In my full size Cadillac sedan, it takes up s lot if space and doesnt leave any room for the front seat to go back. It has a lot of great features, the baby looks very comfortable in it and the seat itself just has a totally premium look and feel. I really like how the bar at the feet helps keep the seat more stable and doesnt allow it to move or shift as easily as other seats do.'}, {'header': 'Most comfortable seat', 'body': 'It’s comfortable seat for large baby which is why I bought it.

Every shock, rattle, and roll is protected through remarkable design and you will never feel more confident than when you place your baby in this seat and get on the road. It is definitely the most expensive one I've seen, but is there any expense that should be spared when it comes to protecting a life?

The materials and construction of this car seat all look and feel top-notch. It's a heavy, sturdy seat with reassuring safety features.I like that this seat allows my child to be in rear-facing mode up to 45lbs. Most car seats have a much lower rear-facing limit. It's really tempting to turn the seat into forward-facing mode as soon as your child reaches the 22lb minimum, but rear-facing mode is MUCH safer, so it's best to keep your child rear-facing as long as possible. Most statistics I have seen claim your child is five times less likely to be seriously injured or killed in rear-facing mode.The rebound bar is an excellent safety feature for rear-facing mode that I highly recommend you use because it helps the seat have a tighter installation and it provides extra protection in the event of a crash. I have another seat with this feature (the Clek Foonf), and the advantage with this Primo Viaggio seat is that the bar simply folds underneath the seat when you switch to forward facing. The rebound bar on the Clek seat has to be detached and stored elsewhere.The one thing that I don't care for so much is the cupholder. It's a little flimsy and it doesn't clip on that securely, plus it's in kind of an awkward position for the child to reach. Considering how well the rest of the seat is designed, the cupholder feels almost like an afterthought. It's not a dealbreaker, but it could be better. I have a Graco Exend2Fit Platinum seat and that has two cupholders built in in a much better position. My Clek Foonf didn't even come with a cupholder and the optional one that you can buy fits much the same as this Primo Viaggio one. Perhaps the side location is safer in the event of a crash so the contents of the cupholder are less likely to hit your child if they fly out.""}, {'header': 'Best of the Best', 'body': ""If you have been searching for the Rolls Royce of baby car seats, look no further. While the Primo Viaggio brand may not exactly be a household name in this country, they have been quietly making some of the highest quality products on the market since 1949.Based in Italy, the company manufactures car seats as well as a number of other innovative child products. Just about all other car seats sold in the U.S. are made in China using the least expensive material available and mass manufactured on an assembly line. This model seems to be practically hand made with a great deal of attention paid to detail and luxury. The safety specs and features go well above the minimum standards required in the U.S. and are the most comprehensive you will find anywhere.The latch system is very simple to use and provides maximum protection. The anti rebound bar and side protection pods are unique safety features that aren't available on any other car seats that I have seen from other manufacturers. This is pretty much the be all end all product when it comes to baby car seats. It definitely comes at a premium price, but if you have that kind of money to spend you will only want the best and this model definitely delivers.""}, {'header': 'This is a great option for a carseat', 'body': ""Out of the box, I was impressed with this car seat. It has great safety features and high-end finishes, such as the leather (synthetic?) outer layer, soft and cushioned seat, and the rebound bar for backward facing kids. My daughter is a small two-year-old and will remain backward facing for an extended period of time. The rebound bar is a safety feature, but also extends the distance from the seat allowing for more leg room.The car seat is easy to install and clips right into my 2018 Highlander's second-row captain seat. It is on the larger size but fits perfectly in the singular seat. The harness clips in securely and my kids can both clip themselves, but require help to release. The harness tightens easily with the pull and releases with the tab. I've hard to rethread a couple of times in as many months due to the threads being twisted. It was easy enough and did not require me to remove the car seat and flip it over as I have had to do with other brands. The seat is padded and feels nice and comfortable. Most importantly it securely latches and I feel that my daughter is safe when riding in this seat. I would definitely repurchase this seat and recommend it to my family.""}, {'header': 'Excellent seat', 'body': 'This is a gorgeous, well made car seat with lots of safety features. Its not one you will want to be switching in and out if vehicles, so make sure it fits with your needs, as well as in your vehicle. I think an SUV is better suited for it if you plan to use the extender bar. In my full size Cadillac sedan, it takes up s lot if space and doesnt leave any room for the front seat to go back.

Every shock, rattle, and roll is protected through remarkable design and you will never feel more confident than when you place your baby in this seat and get on the road.

All car seat on the market has to pass the NTSH 's standards and safety tests. Realize with others you're often paying for unnecessary padding and colors which often can't be removed. Also it is advised that your child be seated rear facing as long as possible, even into 3 and 4 years of age. That being said, if you buy an infant car seat, you will have to buy another convertible car seat when she/he gets too big for it.

We've had it for over 6 months now and I am really happy with the purchase.What I Like:I love that this car seat was reasonable priced but still a quality product. It does exactly what I need it to without paying for a huge car seat with extras that we don't need.It has a fairly narrow design, and fits in my car with a booster seat on each side. This was a must for us as we have 3 kids in our sedan. Also, I'm petite so a big bulky car seat isn't fun to lug around or try to install.Not too bulky, but still seems soft and comfy. My son's not a huge talker, but he hasn't indicated that it's uncomfortable in any way.Easy to install and uninstall when you need to move the car seat. Not too hard to get it correctly installed in a secure position.The strap tension adjustment is easy to use, probably the easiest I've ever used and I know my way around a car seat. You just push the button in the front bottom of the seat and pull the shoulder straps to loosen them, put the baby in the seat and buckle up the harness, then pull the strap on the adjuster at the bottom to make tight with the harness at the armpits of the baby.It comes with a latch system and a tether so you can use either option.The whole seat cover comes off easily and is machine washable. Let's face it, babies are messy and tend to spit up, but the cover came out looking great after going through the washing machine.What it Lacks:The cup holder is pretty weak. We didn't end up using it, one reason being that it's in an awkward spot and would have probably been bothering my daughter in the seat next to it, and we couldn't actually get it to stay on. Even if we could get it to stay, it doesn't look like it is very durable.This car seat is supposed to be a seat for a baby 5-40 lbs, but does not come with any additional padding for an infant. I think a 5 lb baby would be way too tiny for such a large seat, but that's my opinion. I like keeping my babies in an infant car seat until they turn a year old because I like to be able to remove the seat from the car to carry them and also, the infant seats just seem more comfortable for a tiny baby who sleeps all the time. My son was over a year and a pretty solid toddler when I purchased this, so it was perfect for him.Overall, it's been a great car seat! We've been fortunate to not have been in any accidents, so I can't say for sure how it holds up under trauma, but for us it's been perfect. We were on a budget so the price was the main reason for choosing this car seat, but it turned out to be great! I like the simple design and I've been happy with the purchase.""}, {'header': 'Perfect narrow convertible carseat', 'body': ""This is the second time I've had this particular carseat - I used one for my first two children, and purchased a new one due to expiration dates for my son.

The price is excellent, the product is attractive, and best of all, you can get three across in a smaller car. After multiple trips lugging the car seats on the airplane, we decided the extra hour at each end of the trip removing and installing the car seats was too much for the babies and the adults alike. I shopped for months to find a sturdy, safe and inexpensive option. I felt heart-tugs for all the working families who were struggling to make ends meet and were expected to drop $250 for car seats. Then I found this seat. At first I was uncertain about whether it would be good enough but honestly, if you are on a modest budget or if you need it part-time like we do, I cannot think of a better option.Another thing that makes this a super option is its width. It is the narrowest safety seat I could find. We don\'t have a big car so when everyone comes to visit we have to squeeze three babies and 4 adults and a service dog into two Subarus. The width of these seats helps us get everyone into the car. No one can wiggle, not even the dog, but we make it.The one thing I would note is that the installation of the seat when rear facing is a little loose. We fused with it for quite a while and finally decided that it was very secure but not as snug to the car as other seats we had used. We did not observe the same ""play"" when it was forward facing. If I had it in my car full time I might investigate a way to add a strap just to stabilize it a bit more. Call it a grandmother\'s obsession. It might be different in other cars, the Forester back bench-seat is quite flat compared to some cars that have a more concave shape.'}, {'header': 'So far the kids like them.', 'body': 'What I noticed with my other car seats was that the cup holder wasn’t big enough for my kids sippies. But this one seems to work well. The kids seem to like this car seat a lot.'}, {'header': 'Budget friendly car seat!', 'body': 'I purchased this car seat after reading a review on BabyGearLab.com. I\'ve used their site for guidance on several items and they\'ve all proved to be great purchases, including this car seat.We needed another convertible car seat for my spouse\'s car. I wasn\'t willing to cash out another $300 for a Britax and was thrilled to find this seat at an AMAZING price.I\'m surprised at the quality of this seat. Of course it lacks the fancy features of our Britax but for short rides in our second car it is perfect. It\'s also light weight and will be more convenient to use during air travel.From the reading I\'ve done, it\'s recommended to keep your child in an infant car seat until age 9 months to a year. (Most babies outgrow their infant seat due to height, not weight). I don\'t think this seat is best suited for young babies, despite the weight allowances, because there are not different reclining positions. The bottom piece is flipped to one side for rear facing and the other side for forward facing. Our daughter is 13 months and with the seat installed properly and rear facing, the position is significantly upright compared to the angle of an infant car seat. I, personally, would be worried about breathing difficulty with a young infant at such an upright angle.The seat was easy to install in our Chevy Traverse using the LATCH system. From reading the manual, I believe it will be simple to install on an airplane and I will update my review after our experience with that.The ""headrest"" is a lightly padded piece that loops behind the cover and Velcros together. My daughter easily tugs at it and pulls it off so there isn\'t cushion around her head. This isn\'t a huge deal because the seat is inexpensive and we only use it for short rides.I recommend this seat for use in a second car or for a family on a budget. Even though it lacks nicer features of high end brands, I feel confident this seat will protect my child.'}, {'header': 'MONEY WELL SPENT', 'body': 'SHIPPINGItem arrived in time as promised tucked in a sturdy cardboard shipping box.

This car seat is very light but it is also sturdy. Adjusting the harness is easy and convenient. Adjusting the harness on the other car seat ( the expensive one ) is a Hercules task. The seating pad is soft yet firm. Fits perfect for my daughter. Has a cup holder that is detachable. The best part of this car seat is its weight. It is so light I could carry it all over the terminal without feeling the weight. It fits perfectly in a Delta domestic flight which was a Boeing ( Not sure about the Aircraft model) . However, It did not fit on a Spirit flight which was an Airbus. I had to do the gate check in, for that particular flight.It looks sturdy and feels well built but can not comment on the quality until it is out to a test which I would not want. Going through the previous reviews, I remember some one mentioning about the real life test and how it saved the child. So I feel, it should do well in case of an unfortunate event.WHAT IS NOT SO GOOD ABOUT ITThe only minor issue is with the cup holder. It does not stay in place when you load it up with a heavy cup. I can use some glue to put it in place but then it is beats the idea of ""detachable cup holder"".Bottom LineIt is value for money and the best car seat If you have to carry it on a flight or use it on a rental car.Would I recommend it to a friendYes, I would.'}, {'header': 'Perfect to use on trips', 'body': 'We visit LA often from SF to visit family and have been making the trek by car.

I was very pleased with how the carseat worked for us. First, it's super light-weight! Very easy to carry through the airport (we used the Evecase car seat travel bag to cart it through the airport) as well as down the aisle of the airplane to your seat. It wasn't small enough to go through the security scanner, so we did have to remove it from the bag to be examined individually, but that's not really a surprise. The carseat itself is fairly easy to figure out, although the included instructions aren't great (it was difficult to figure out how to switch the straps from forward facing to rear facing, as it's not in the instructions at all). I would recommend you taking time to adjust the strap length and crotch strap location before the trip - it's not hard, but not super easy either, and you don't want to be messing with that in the plane. We flew both Alaska and Delta, and the car seat fit awesome into the seat (used it forward facing). The belt buckle does center right in the middle of the back, so we used a receiving blanket under our son to make it more comfortable. I'm so glad we took the car seat on board - it was a bit of a pain, but made the trip so much easier for him and for us by keeping him confined in a safe, familiar place.

I would like to mention that it comes with the latch system but the latch hooks are very hidden!! There is no red button and they aren’t like normal latches. They are black hooks that are clipped to the sides of the back of the car seat. The hooks are clipped to the top of the back of the seat so look closely at the car seat before you get ready to install it. Unhook them then you can attach to the latch system then pull tight sonits snug. Then the seat belt can go through and hook the seat belt in. For forward facing there is also a black hook to clip to the top of the back seat so check for that too. If you have not purchased this yet and are not looking for something light weight to carry on an airplane I suggest looking at more expensive seats if you can afford it because there aren’t any options for a canopy to block out the sun and there isn’t a built in cup holder for snack or a bottle and is only good until 40lbs unlike more expensive seats good until 70 or 80 pounds.

It's easy to put on and seems comfortable for my kid. The latch is secure and there's plenty of strap to accommodate bigger kids. The cover comes off easily to be washed at any time.One thing to keep in mind is that this car seat requires a lot of manual adjustments as the child grows. For example, moving the shoulder straps one notch up requires taken off the seat from the car, unhooking the straps from a metal piece and then moving the straps up. This doesn't take very long, 10-15 minutes, but it's something to keep in mind. The straps also don't come with any cushions for the shoulders or crotch, so if you're worried about comfort then you might want to look for other products that offer that.All in all, I'm quite happy with it.

We have cold winters here and have a first responder in the family, so despite what the car seat ""experts"" advise we always leave winter coats on in the car. With that being said, baby fits nice and securely in the car seat with winter gear on, so if we were ever in an accident during freezing cold weather we are confident baby will be as safe and warm as possible.

With this one, you dont get a lot of the more advanced features that the graco offers, but then again, it was $240 cheaper.My wife is a huge fan of the straps on this one, she actually prefers them over the graco. She says that they seem to pull back when you pull them out to get the babies arms in, thus helping to restrain an unruly little beast.She does have one complaint about it. Her being a lefty, she says it is a bit difficult to get to the release button as its at a funny angle. Me being a righty, I have no issues, so I reckon that as long as youre one of the ""normal"" humans out there, you shouldnt have any issues.Would I use this car seat as my main car seat?

This carseat was so light to carry around. With 3 luggages and a baby, I can't imagine carrying around heavier and larger carseat at the airport. I could hold this carseat using my one hand with other luggages. Installation was breeze too. It was as easy as installing our Chicco Nextfit which costs over $350. I easily installed this carseat in two uber cars and we were ready to head to and from the airport in less than 30 seconds. My daughter seemed comfy in the carseat and she slept well during the entire travel. We are now using this carseat for our 2nd car, and will be using it again during our next travel. I would highly recommend this carseat if you are planning to use it during travel. One downside is that it can only be reclined to two positions- forward or rear facing. Depending on your seat angle, you may have to use a rolled towel or a pool noodle to adjust rear-facing angle.

It's super lightweight and relatively easy to install on a plane. The downside is that installing in a car is more difficult than some other models. Don't bother trying to use the latch, it's easier to use the seat belt installation. If your kid is rear facing, plan on taking a rolled up towel. The instructions even tell you to use a rolled up towel for correct installation, which to me seems indicative of a design flaw, but for this price...the straps are very easy to adjust tighter or looser, a feature that is lacking in our fancy seat.It's lightly padded, but consider taking a small towel or pad to put behind your kid's back if you use it on a plane, because the buckle is often right in the kid's back and it may be uncomfortable due to the light/little padding in the seat itself.

I did have to use a towel folded when rear facing, due to how my back seat is, others had mentioned it in reviews so I understood it.One thing I would change is some sort of strap for the latch system to keep it attached to the carseat when you take it out- it had a plastic tie on it when I got it, but I had to cut it to move the latch belt for rear facing use.'}]","[{'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91voyDZyYoL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Evenflo-Tribute-Convertible-Seat-Saturn-1.jpg', 'checksum': 'f3acd082a21c244704486efc406675d7', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91voyDZyYoL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Evenflo-Tribute-Convertible-Seat-Saturn-1.jpg', 'checksum': 'f3acd082a21c244704486efc406675d7', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81b5ePDyA8L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Evenflo-Tribute-Convertible-Seat-Saturn-3.jpg', 'checksum': '9a47f52a4923f4d32759571b15f16237', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91yGRKTIfJL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Evenflo-Tribute-Convertible-Seat-Saturn-4.jpg', 'checksum': '8e4e10da11afd261d764c92212ee11f8', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TeeS5fy4L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Evenflo-Tribute-Convertible-Seat-Saturn-5.jpg', 'checksum': '98c4fa587a1727a2438e21be6a1ea153', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/915wycUON7L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Evenflo-Tribute-Convertible-Seat-Saturn-6.jpg', 'checksum': '6f960e6692a36bf8fe8456dcbea67915', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/916wrb5uE8L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Evenflo-Tribute-Convertible-Seat-Saturn-7.jpg', 'checksum': 'a3bebddf5b86a4fdb68029875f6b1502', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91G7mEJLs+L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Evenflo-Tribute-Convertible-Seat-Saturn-8.jpg', 'checksum': '1f5d5f9c2c86ece9ea972626a86b4a3e', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619mmd8+joL._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Evenflo-Tribute-Convertible-Seat-Saturn-9.jpg', 'checksum': 'be4ac8e993a0bbe733b45f11e74001e9', 'status': 'uptodate'}]",,Car Seat,"B019EGMGR0,B08WJFRQ91,B00K2ZFHAG,B07S27HVLK,B09NKN9ST8,B00J3KL4HG,B079W46W4L,B07XLG6BJH,B07ZWVKR73,B00ISCPJM6,B07BB5VXBW,B01GVJ65MA,B00O9W4704,B07VHVH7YF,B08DTF8VNC,B089MJNSMW,B08Q1LS11S,B081DB6F4D,B08V3CJ85W,B09KTFYKBK,B07YNDK15M,B019EGMGNE,B004CVDQUO,B07QV3118Z,B08VZK14KZ,B00O8RRRSO,B083XVXV7L,B08RFYHMPW,B08SCNB67G,B08SCPHL1Q,B017VNNTX8,B07MC48TNP,B091B58LFD,B07QTYGYLZ,B08YQ4L4Y7,B08586LYYL,B084K44651,B08TX4K5TJ,B09382PVFM,B084K4BXHP,B07NM559VL,B09NPM265Q,B08PDLGG2L,B0938K24VC,B09311PL54,B08PDKM8HJ,B08YQ1NV6N,B0929L3HV6,B08Z2P55HM,B09881YNV8,B08398MV69,B09LKL9NWZ,B09Q7XFCH5,B095L484LJ,B07L4JPQ64,B07T25WNL3,B06XSMY6Y3,B06XG17VNF,B0728GXF8V,B07FQ6M8CR,B07N28BMB5,B08L9K2MHS,B01N6Z70BR,B087H3XJ49,B07ZS4QBVF,B0921CBPG7,B08K2GX7PP,B071VHBYX8,B09YTN79H7,B07R1CPT7Z,B07DGPGQXN,B071L1NG6N,B006PB2B6O,B08C779LF4,B07L47ZRPW,B00PTL2BE8,B07CZT4M2Y,B06VY1DFQN,B00838BNK2,B07CVCHKTT,B07HML1BT5,B07XTWM2XL,B07H8VTTCP,B07XSC4284,B01N3MYMB2,B01N3MYVZM,B01ETUBQZ4,B07XSBT57H,B07J37RTPG,B07KBPKJYT,B07XSBK4Z2,B01MRE9IOC,B0828M8G61,B07YXP3Y2Z,B07HNTTWY8,B07TGX255N,B09RNDW2LH,B01N5P7G80,B07Y5S4VWT,B07MSPMKPQ",,,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PB2B6O,,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91voyDZyYoL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81b5ePDyA8L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91yGRKTIfJL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TeeS5fy4L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/915wycUON7L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/916wrb5uE8L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91G7mEJLs+L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619mmd8+joL._SL1000_.jpg",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91voyDZyYoL._SL1500_.jpg

The easy 1 button release to adjust the straps makes it easy and fast to find the most secure yet comfortable position for your child to be securely placed quickly. The soft liner is removable! And the liner and cups are easy to clean! It terms of safety, it has a solid rating for car seats. However, I saw an additional Amazon review where a parent was in a very bad car accident and the vehicle was likely a total loss due to the significant damage to the vehicle. And the parent showed how the car seat held up post accident along with the vehicle damage photos with no injury to the child really helped me decide to get this car seat. I don’t want any parent to ever have to find out how “safe” a car seat really is due to an accident. But it was very beneficial to me to be able to see that review and apply the knowledge of car accident investigation to make a decision to purchase this car seat. Lastly, my child seems to like his new car seat! He watches his shows on his tablet and eats plenty snacks/beverage’s comfortably!'}, {'header': 'The best car seat I’ve purchased.', 'body': 'The color is amazing. Material is so soft and easy, too easy to install. The recliner, I don’t have ask my other kids to hold their baby sisters head when she’s asleep.'}, {'header': 'Spacious with an easy to use buckle', 'body': 'I chose this Chicco MyFit Harness + Booster Car Seat for my toddler as I read about its easy to use buckle. My past rear facing car seats had buckles that were clumsy. Having used this car seat for the last month it has been a breeze to use. My kid loved the seat the moment I installed it. It is on the heavy side and feels solidly constructed. The two full-sized cup holders on either size are useful for both kids as well as anyone else sitting the back seat. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone else shopping for a high quality car seat.'}, {'header': 'Love this carseat', 'body': 'Easy to install and more importantly, so easy to loosen straps to get my toddler out. We loved our old graco car seat but having to stick a finger into a hole to loosen straps and it still being a struggle was not pleasant. This car seat has the button to loosen easily accessible and we loop the straps around the arm rests to easily put our kid in without digging straps out from behind them. Also love the padded chest clip. The only negative is that if we don’t slide the shoulder pads down before tightening, it can pinch our kids neck, but easy fix. Awesome car seat.'}, {'header': 'Nice arm rest and good cup holder', 'body': 'I decided to change my 5 year old daughter car seat because the one we had was expensive but we didn’t like the cup holder, and also making room for a infant along with my son’s booster seat . But apart from that it as a sleek shape my daughter love it she also loves the arm rest definitely would buy again.'}, {'header': 'Totalled the car with my kid!', 'body': ""I've loved this carseat since I bought it. While it's true it's comfortable and easy to install with easy height ajustements; you buy it for the safety in an accident. My car looked like a storm blew through it, but the carseat looked untouched with the cherry drink STILL in the cup holder! My son had no pain, no injuries, not even sore the next day meanwhile my car was totalled. I'd pay twice as much for this carseat now that I've seen it perform and protect my entire world in that little boy!""}, {'header': 'Great seat', 'body': ""We bought this when my son was 3 to replace a Graco. He's tall, 90th+ % for height and weight- at 2 he was 40lb/40inches. This seat kept him in a harness until right at his 6th birthday. Then it effortlessly converted to a HBB. It's higher profile than other boosters so it was incredibly hard for him to reach the buckle due to the design of my car, but now it's in gmas car. Best thing is that this seat hardly looks used. I was the cover and it looks new. Very easy to get a secure install and my child was able to get himself in and out of the 5pt harness (while putting the chest clip in the right spot and making the straps tight enough). I'm now looking for a chicco for my new baby!""}, {'header': 'My toddlers head does not fall forward when asleep!!!', 'body': ""My 3 year old loves his new carseat, it gives him ample room due to him being very tall for his age. The carseat itself is a bit heavy, but that was to be expected. I had no trouble installing the seat and it fits perfectly, with room to spare in my Toyota Camry. Our seat is forward facing, and I keep it reclined on the 3. My toddlers head NEVER falls forward when he goes to sleep!!!!! I didn't know that was possible in a carseat - it's absolutely perfect in every way! 10/10 recommend.""}, {'header': 'comfortable, safe ride', 'body': 'My preschooler is big and tall, and his head would always flop forward when he fell asleep in his old convertible carseat. I researched several seats before deciding on this one, and I\'m glad we made this choice. Our infant seat was a Chicco KeyFit, and I loved that seat. This one is just as good, comfortable, and easy to use.Here are my favorite features:1. This one is lighter weight than many other well-reviewed models, but has plenty of important safety features and high ratings.2. The padding around the headrest area is substantial without feeling like I\'m strapping my son into a spaceship. He can see better out the windows of the car thanks to the shape of the headrest ""wings"" without compromising head and neck protection.3. When he falls asleep in the car, his head gently rests upright at a normal position against the headrest ""wing"", instead of falling forward at an awkward, uncomfortable angle like it did in his convertible.4. The two flexible cupholders have been really useful. He can reach them easily, and the flexible material makes it feel less cheap and fragile.5. It\'s easy keeping this seat clean- you can remove the cover, and the hard pieces wipe down easily.6. It was easy to install in the car- I have a heftier well-rated convertible seat from another brand that has served us well, but is a pain to get in and out of cars and airplanes. This one is straightforward, with a level and guide labels to make it easy.7. It\'s a pretty new model, and seems like it\'s based on recent research and technology. This isn\'t just a reboot of other seats that have been selling well forever. It\'s a well-executed ergonomic design, with thoughtful shaping of safety features that still allow for a comfortable experience.When shopping for a toddler harness booster, I was primarily deciding between the Britax models and this one. Safety is my number one concern, but I also want my child to be comfortable. I am sure a Britax seat could have been a good choice as well, but in the end, I am glad we went with the Chicco MyFit for our family.'}, {'header': 'Holds up well', 'body': 'This was given as a gift, and they use it everyday, and said that it is a good car seat.'}, {'header': ""Just bite the bullet, you'll thank yourself later"", 'body': ""This seat is amazing. We have put our kids in Chicco seats since they were born and we don't regret ponying up the extra cash. Imagine if you had to sit in a hot hard plastic seat for hours? You'd hate life too, thanks stupid NHSTA. Anyway, this seat makes this a much more pleasant experience because it’s got a great gangster lean, soft breathy cloth, and plenty of room. If the dude falls asleep, he just leans on the head thingy and his head doesn't flop forward like on other cheapy seats. They sit up as high as an adult, and the cupholders are nice and big because America. Getting a route44 in there is very important for a 4 year old you know? Get this one over the cheaper one because it has the zip fit, air cloth, and anchor latches with the cinch fit. Those zip covers are the best invention ever because your kid IS going to spill stuff (or puke on it) at some point, and with the zip covers you don't need a degree in puzzle solving to get the cover off.****Update April 2021****I had to buy another booster for my second kid. I looked at the level down from this without the 3d air cloth and realized that the lower tier model no longer comes with cinch fit connections! For that reason alone you should buy this one vs to two lower tier ones. Not having to deal with the seatbelt routing is a great thing. We have two vans and have to move the seats from van to van and the cinch fit quick connects make that a much easier process. Do yourself a favor pay the extra money for this one, you won't be sorry. The first seat we bought still looks brand new, and my older one loves it.""}]","[{'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PTutERtDL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-1.jpg', 'checksum': '7d5334009517a4f0fe81323acfe61ec2', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RnCAipb-L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-2.jpg', 'checksum': '4065cf20d127a1c5612ba2d1b2217adb', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ezlcsGoIL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-3.jpg', 'checksum': '2639b5e78300702b8af459a63c6fb9fa', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fz3zOv5EL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-4.jpg', 'checksum': 'e7f61e0821462d0f39e82209ebe370bb', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91SMPmH6MfL._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-5.jpg', 'checksum': 'd28df3bed19e72b08c812d441ec28bc0', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91aciUTOLML._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-6.jpg', 'checksum': '03762cdb3037a9c960023d4616753b3b', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8195o7Umh3L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-7.jpg', 'checksum': '73bf0a7b5e5a3275d9efa241c702203d', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1Jal5+092L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-8.jpg', 'checksum': 'ec3378091b8fb13f3b3fc9545c701191', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1cOrlLar3L._SL1500_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-9.jpg', 'checksum': '59993699bc38f6570d5973608b5118e7', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712Z1ah7PbL._SL1380_.jpg', 'path': 'Chicco-MyFit-Harness-Booster-Fathom-10.jpg', 'checksum': '71e55c6c4036d05a914ac865ee7d2356', 'status': 'uptodate'}]",Atmosphere$$$Fathom/Grey/Blue$$$Gardenia$$$Granite$$$Nightfall$$$Q-Collection$$$Shadow,Car Seat,"B019EGMGR0,B08WJFRQ91,B00K2ZFHAG,B07S27HVLK,B09NKN9ST8,B00J3KL4HG,B079W46W4L,B07XLG6BJH,B07ZWVKR73,B00ISCPJM6,B07BB5VXBW,B01GVJ65MA,B00O9W4704,B07VHVH7YF,B08DTF8VNC,B089MJNSMW,B08Q1LS11S,B081DB6F4D,B08V3CJ85W,B09KTFYKBK,B07YNDK15M,B019EGMGNE,B004CVDQUO,B07QV3118Z,B08VZK14KZ,B00O8RRRSO,B083XVXV7L,B08RFYHMPW,B08SCNB67G,B08SCPHL1Q,B017VNNTX8,B07MC48TNP,B091B58LFD,B07QTYGYLZ,B08YQ4L4Y7,B08586LYYL,B084K44651,B08TX4K5TJ,B09382PVFM,B084K4BXHP,B07NM559VL,B09NPM265Q,B08PDLGG2L,B0938K24VC,B09311PL54,B08PDKM8HJ,B08YQ1NV6N,B0929L3HV6,B08Z2P55HM,B09881YNV8,B08398MV69,B09LKL9NWZ,B09Q7XFCH5,B095L484LJ,B07L4JPQ64,B07T25WNL3,B06XSMY6Y3,B06XG17VNF,B0728GXF8V,B07FQ6M8CR,B07N28BMB5,B08L9K2MHS,B01N6Z70BR,B087H3XJ49,B07ZS4QBVF,B0921CBPG7,B08K2GX7PP,B071VHBYX8,B09YTN79H7,B07R1CPT7Z,B07DGPGQXN,B071L1NG6N,B006PB2B6O,B08C779LF4,B07L47ZRPW,B00PTL2BE8,B07CZT4M2Y,B06VY1DFQN,B00838BNK2,B07CVCHKTT,B07HML1BT5,B07XTWM2XL,B07H8VTTCP,B07XSC4284,B01N3MYMB2,B01N3MYVZM,B01ETUBQZ4,B07XSBT57H,B07J37RTPG,B07KBPKJYT,B07XSBK4Z2,B01MRE9IOC,B0828M8G61,B07YXP3Y2Z,B07HNTTWY8,B07TGX255N,B09RNDW2LH,B01N5P7G80,B07Y5S4VWT,B07MSPMKPQ",,,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DGPGQXN,,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RnCAipb-L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ezlcsGoIL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fz3zOv5EL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91SMPmH6MfL._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91aciUTOLML._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8195o7Umh3L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1Jal5+092L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1cOrlLar3L._SL1500_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712Z1ah7PbL._SL1380_.jpg",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PTutERtDL._SL1500_.jpg

I also feel like the padding on the seat is more comfortable than the cheaper ones. We bought a $65 one before this and ended up throwing it away. If you’re looking for an affordable car seat that feels safe this was a good choice for us. It does have steel reinforcements which make me feel more comfortable than the all plastic car seats.

(Obviously safety mattered too). Our Encore is tiny and we were having issues fitting an infant car seat next to a convertible rear facing car seat. We were able to make it work with this seat. My daughter loves it and calls it cozy. It’s easy for parents to buckle and adjust as our child grows etc. It was heavier and a little more difficult to install than our Safety 1st but this didn’t matter to us as we don’t move the seat.

Glad to have the 1 cupholder as opposed to 2, and I like the switchable piece under the carseat for switching from rear to forward facing.

A SUV ran a red light at full speed without stopping or slowing down and hit my car right in the middle of the intersection. From point of impact to where my car finally stopped was about 30 feet. My car was airborne and spun several times through both sides of lanes on the road. My car hit the curb and that is what made it stop moving from the impact, halfway down the road.It was sudden, and I saw nothing before impact. My first thought was if my 6 year old was secure in his car seat and soon at the car stopped moving I immediately looked to the back for my son.This car seat literally saved my son's life. The er doctor said the car seat acted like a bubble that protected my son from both the force of impact and any movement that could cause physical injuries.I have some physical injuries from the accident but my son walked away with not even a scratch.I would buy this car seat all over again if I had to.Since my son is now 6 I am buying him the transition seat by this brand.I can't tell you how important it is to buckle up your kids in a 5 point harness for as long as you possibly can and always use a car seat appropriate for their weight.I see people in my town drive around with their young children, some younger than my son without a car seat. It literally scares me to see kids not in a car seat after the bad accident we were in.I love this seat for my son and can't recommend it enough.""}, {'header': 'Great product', 'body': 'This is a great product.

The access for this is 2 buttons on the bottom of the seat that you press together to lift up the seat to thread the belt. It does have latch but since Britax recommends belt install I have never used or attempted with latch. Thread the belt, buckle, remove any slack and then press the seat back down until it clicks. For a tight install, I find I have to remove enough slack from the belt that I have to kind of kneel on the seat to have it click back into place. In doing this, the seat doesn’t budge at all.As far as comfort goes, my son never seems to be uncomfortable and there appears to be plenty of padding. My 13 lb 3-month old uses the infant insert and the padding is quite thick. The cup holders are excellent. I’ve yet to find a standard 12-oz kids water bottle that doesn’t fit. They easily remove for washing. I recently took all the seat fabric off to wash. It washed and dried wonderfully following the instructions and I didn’t even need a YouTube video to replace the fabric which was a first.This is not a slim fit or lightweight seat. If you frequently need to switch it to a different car, it probably is not the seat for you. While it removes and reinstalls easily, it is quite heavy and cumbersome to move around. I could fit 3 of these across in my expedition with a bench seat, but in a smaller vehicle like my outback, 2 could definitely fit in the outboard seats but an adult would definitely struggle to fit in between. The seat however feels like a tank and this was a big factor in purchasing a second for my infant.The seat adjusts very easily as my son has grown. The straps easily adjust by moving up the headrest. The tension on the straps easily adjusts by pulling the strap at the leg portion of the seat and releasing by pressing a button below the click tight and pulling the straps. I should add that my son is very tall for his age and has plenty of legroom while rear facing.I don’t have any review of the forward facing functions and adjustments for this seat but have no doubt it will be just as easy to adjust as rear facing.'}, {'header': 'Only Car Seat I Will Ever Buy', 'body': 'I purchased this car seat for my 10-month-old grandson because he out-grew his carrier but still needed to be rear-facing.

I throw the soft material in the wash on a gentle cycle and spray out the rest with a hose.

My criteria for a car seat was something durable, reliable, safe, convertible, and easy to install. This Britax One4Life car seat is all of those things and more! I purchased the charcoal gray color - as opposed to all black - and absolutely love it. It's still dark enough to hide any dirt/messes pretty well, and works for either a boy or girl. My favorite feature is that it is soooo easy to install in the car. The seat bottom flips up and you simply extend the car seatbelt over the hard base of the car seat and click it into place. Push the seat bottom back down and you're done! I also love that this car seat will grow with my child.

He rides well in this seat with no complaints of being uncomfortable. He isn’t sweaty when we take him out of the seat.He did get sick one day while I was driving with him alone (super scary!).The seat was easy to clean and looks AND SMELLS amazing even after a huge mess!I really like the fact that it is easy to install. When he is super tired I am able to adjust in the recline (while staying within the guidelines) to something a little more comfortable for snoozing.Love this seat! Worth every penny!Just wish it came with the anti rebound bar...Seems crazy to spend another $55 - especially during a pandemic when we don’t travel often or far.Bottom line - BUY THIS SEAT!UPDATEWe have had the replacement seat for a little over three months.Return of the original seat was super easy via Kohl’s. The new seat came on time and in perfect condition.Our chunk lives this seat!He is super comfortable.It is amazingly easy to install via the lower anchors.Our little one was always sweaty in the infant seat but that hasn’t been a problem in this one.He can see out well so he is happy - maybe he doesn’t feel trapped?Getting him in and out of the seat is easy since the straps stay off to the sides well and the center buckle stays forward so I’m not fumbling for it and struggling with a mobile baby at the same time.If we had the extra funds I would purchase a second one for our Subaru!Moving this seat around is rather cumbersome as it is heavy and awkward for me to move (I’m 5’1” and 110 pounds). The thought of carrying it inside the house makes me cringe but it is a stationary seat so that isn’t a problem.It feels sturdy. When I put him in the seat I know he is safe. I love the padding at the head and couldn’t ask for more from a seat!Other than the straps pull uneven if you yank them from one side I haven’t had any trouble with this seat. Easy fix - pull both straps as it is a Y type system. It’s easy to fix by pulling the shorter strap to adjust until even.Overall - we love this seat! TOTALLY worth the investment!**Amazon delivered this seat on time and undamaged from shipment.We ordered this seat for our nearly 22lb 6 month old as (we gave out Chicco KeyFit to our daughter) our son was uncomfortable in his infant seat on rides lasting longer than 15 minutes. He is just too wide to be comfortable in the Chicco KeyFit.**We loved the KeyFit and would have kept him in it until he reached the maximum height and weight if he wasn’t a short stocky little chunk!I was so excited for this seat to arrive and have a comfortable seat for a little guy. Thank goodness I noticed this screw before installing this seat in my car!! I have no idea if a screw is missing from the inside components of the seat or if an extra one somehow managed to get trapped during manufacturing...I have Amazon sending a replacement that will arrive Monday (this seat came Saturday evening - it now 8am Sunday morning). I am now trapped at home until the new seat arrives. Amazon said they couldn’t get a replacement to me today.I will update once we get the replacement. After all of this I hope the seat lives up to the hype.'}, {'header': 'Spend the extra money', 'body': ""We got this car seat over the graco 4 in 1 and I am happy we did.

My husband and I both had injuries, the car’s frame was bent, entire back end smashed, and driver’s seat twisted on its frame. Our child came out of the accident without a bruise or scratch, completely unfazed. Without a doubt, this car seat did its job and helped protect him from harm. It could have been so much worse. The emergency personnel inspected the car seat afterwards and nothing was compromised; they were impressed. We’ve already ordered the replacement; thank you Britax.'}, {'header': 'This is it!!! No matter how big or small your car it, the only car seat you will need!', 'body': 'This car seat is everything I have been looking for and it came out just in time!I wanted an extended rear facing car seat up to 50 pounds, as I’ve read that rear facing as long as possible is best for little ones’ spines (in Sweden I think their kids rear face until 4!).I also wanted the seat to be convertible to a front facing and booster seat as well so i wouldn’t have to create lots of waste with multiple car seats over the years.And of course I wanted it to be safe.I did tons of research on the web and consumer reports and narrowed it down to the Chicco nextfit max (though this doesn’t have the booster option), this car seat, and the graco extend2fit.The graco extend2fit would have been my choice if this car seat had not come out. But this car seat wins for several reasons over the graco.The ease of install is incredible. I don’t have to worry about messing with the latch, and I only have to close the click tight panel under the seat once I put the seatbelt across.This is also so padded and comfortable, my mom sat in it and was impressed how nice it was!The final factor was how well it fits in my 2013 Prius C. I was worried when researching that I’d have a hard time finding a seat that fit, especially an extended rear facing seat. This fits the bill perfectly as there is still room in the front seat for a passenger (though not a particularly long legged one, but still, I was expecting not to have room for a front seat passenger!).TL;DR stop searching and get this car seat today if it is in your budget!!! Although this is on the pricier side, the safety of my child is totally worth it to me. When I consider that the seat will last 10 years, and that I spend more on eating out some months than I did on this car seat, it puts things in perspective and is well worth the investment.Please give this review a thumbs up if it was helpful :)'}, {'header': 'Highest safety rating (2020), Great quality, Britax needs to fix lack of replacement fabric', 'body': ""I am very picky on quality. Amazon honestly has a 'mixed bag' of great, good, average and just downright bad products from third-party sellers. I only leave written reviews for truly great items, as I don't have time to write for everything I purchase.I purchased this car seat because it had the highest safety rating on the market (2020). I was very happy with the quality of construction and craftsmanship when the unit was delivered. A year later, I still feel the same way.Will it last for 10 years of use as a convertible car seat, as claimed? The physical unit probably will. It is that well built. The fabric is also very high quality, however I can't imagine 10 years of spills, pukes, messes and general wear leaving the fabric in great condition. That is to be expected, and would apply to any convertible car seat.The fabric on the seat is removeable. The manual says to look at the tag on the fabric to see if it is machine washable. I cannot find the tag, but believe that it is most likely washable. Unfortunately, I tried to purchase a second set of fabric covers. I search both Amazon and Britax's website, and they appear NOT to be offered for this unit. That was the only significant disappointment we had, and something Britax could / should fix. Ultimately however, my decision came down to the safety rating, knowing if the 'fabric didn't make it 10 years,' I would have to purchase a new one.Installing the first time was very confusing, but this was our first child, so I attribute this 'problem' to my lack of experience and not Britax. It took me a solid 30 to 40 minutes. We purchased a second Britax (same model) for our other car. When installing that one, I found it took no more than 15 minutes. If I had to do it again, it would probably take 10 minutes.""}, {'header': 'IN LOVE!!', 'body': 'LOVE LOVE LOVE this seat!!!! So easy to use and very safe!! I’m a critical care paramedic, and I’ve seen quite a few bad accidents in my years. Britax is SO sturdy and I’ve seen many kids with no injuries when sitting in their properly buckled & secured car seats. This seat makes it SO EASY to properly install! I would purchase again and definitely recommend this seat! (Currently using this seat for a 48lb 8yr old, 46inches in forward facing harness mode. She has a TON of room to grow and says this is the most comfortable seat she’s ever sat in! She loves it!)'}, {'header': 'BEST CAR SEAT - STOP SEARCHING AND BUY THIS ONE', 'body': 'FINALLY FOUND A CARSEAT THAT WORKS! This was the 3rd car seat we tried (we tried safety first, maxi cosi, and Graco before this one). We had issues getting the other car seats tight enough in both of our cars - they always moved more than 2 inches. But not his one!!!The “click tight” feature when installing made the process super quick (less than 2 minutes), and made the car seat extremely tight and non moveable. When pushing and pulling on it from side to side, the car seat does not budge at all. I feel extremely safe having my daughter in this car seat. Such a plus that it was easy to install, no more cutting up my hand as I try and fit my wrist in the small belt path to feed the belt through.I also love that it has so many different positions/recline options rather than competing brands only having 3 positions.After having this car seat for 2 months, it still remains very tight and non movable in my car. My daughter seems very comfortable in it. The Graco was not comfortable at all. Britax and maxi cosi were very comparable and felt about the same thickness in padding. This Britax seat is very well made and heavy duty. When comparing with the maxi cosi, the Britax is definitely much heavier, but that is because it is much more solid/durable in its frame - which to me means more safety.The only issue I have had was that the straps became uneven after a months use, which could very likely be from something I did when getting her in and out. I was able to take the car seat out, and pull the straps in and out a few times and fixed the issue. I would give this seat a 10/10 and would purchase again. We spent MONTHS finding the right seat, I wish we would have found this first and saved ourselves a lot of trouble. Spend the extra money and get this one!'}, {'header': 'Well-thought our features and excellent quality', 'body': 'I really love Britax Clicktight seats. We’ve owned a few of them, and they are excellent quality and have superb safety features. They are also made right here in the good ol US of A. The new SafeWash fabrics are naturally flame retardant free (so no added chemicals) and are super fluffy for max comfort. The seat has mesh on the sides for extra ventilation to keep kids cool, which is appreciated in Houston. 🥵 The cover can also be tossed in the washer AND dried in the drier! Another feature I liked was that the seat portion of the cover and the head/back portion are separate so you don’t have to wash the whole thing if only one portion is dirty. The cup holders are also removable and dishwasher safe (winner!). Finally, the seat has an optional anti-rebound bar, which installs at the foot of the car seat and braces it against the seat so it doesn’t go wiggling about in a crash (so it decreases the risk of head/neck trauma). This was a HUGE benefit for me! As a bonus, the anti-rebound bar is covered in fabric so it will keep little shoes off the back of your seat.The seat itself has a pretty small footprint when installed on the most upright setting. There are built in levels on both sides of the seat to show you if the install angle is correct. The manual is easy to read and beautifully color coded to the seat - which I appreciate. The install is really easy, and is meant to be done with the seatbelt so you don’t have to remember to switch from the latch connectors when your baby gets to a certain weight (30 lbs for this seat, by the way).One final thing to mention is that Britax allows the use of their brand accessories with their seats. This is sort of handy because it allows you to put a seat protector mat under the car seat, add a seat back protector so little feet don’t get your vehicle seat dirty, or add a waterproof piddle mat to the bottom of the car seat to protect it from independent semi-potty-trained toddlers and their accidents.'}, {'header': 'Seat has survived two major accidents (replaced after each)', 'body': 'My poor son has been in two fairly major car accidents in the last two years, both times he was fortunately completely protected by this car seat. The first accident he was in the back drivers side, I was driving a crossover SUV and was rear ended at a stop light by a Full sized truck and flown into the sedan in front of me, so double impact. My son was 11 months at the time and didn’t have a single bruise or even red mark from the chest strap, while I sustained permanent injuries.The second accident happened in a similar way when my son was 22 months. My husband was driving his truck, our son in the middle back. He was stopped at a light when a drunk driver hit him at an estimated 60+ mph. All three vehicles involved were completely totaled. My sons car seat, as shown in the picture, did not move an inch. He sustained zero injuries and wasn’t even sore the next day.I’ve always loved this seat because adjusting the straps and taking him out of the seat is so easy. It looks great, easy to clean, and not super bulky. But most importantly I am 100% confident in this seat after protecting my son not only once, but twice. I will never buy another brand! (Of course I did have to buy a replacement after each accident). Thank you britax for savings my sons life!'}, {'header': 'Excellent seat', 'body': ""I love this car seat, I already have one and knew I wanted the same when my daughter was born. My only complaint is that my new model doesn't come with britax's usually snap in buckle to install it to the seat, it's not the cheap metal standard one every brand uses. That was one of my favorite features bc of the ease for install and remove.

I have tried everything but it won’t come apart so I doubt I will use it unfortunately when I’m using the system as a bassinet. Other than that I really don’t have anything to complain about.

I know she did intense research before deciding on this particular product. I have a peace of mind knowing my grandchild will be transported safely.'}, {'header': 'Great Stroller!', 'body': 'This is my very first stroller that I bought for my baby boy which will be here in September. I bought it despite all the negative reviews, because I fell in love with it! I received it in two days, and the first thing I did was open it. My brother took everything out, but I assembled everything. I\'m 7 months pregnant, and it was very easy to put together and especially very light-weight. Should I emphasize, it was very very easy to put together and the instructions were very clear and straightforward with images. I was almost going to buy the navy blue, but I read in one of the reviews that it didn\'t include a cover for the bassinet so I decided to go with the casual grey not knowing if it had it or not. That was the best thing that I did, because it did come with a cover! I tried it out of course without a baby on it, but the wheels seem to work fine (I will update later when I have my baby about wheel function). The wheels are plastic and rubber, so they will function better at hard floors and cement, but that doesn\'t bother me because I will buy a jogger when my baby outgrows this stroller (which is when he reaches 50 lbs). The base when folded stays put on the ground, which makes the transition between car seat and bassinet very practical. The car seat base seems to have all the safety features needed, and the car seat looks very comfortable for the baby. I also love that the car seat has a canopy to protect the baby from the sun. Overall I am very happy with the stroller and can\'t wait to use it. It\'s practical, lightweight, and very cute. I will update this review once I have my baby, but for now the stroller is a five-star!***Update***I\'ve used this stroller now for 9 months now. The wheels occasionally squeak because, like I said, they are plastic and rubber. A little bit of oil and they are good to go. It\'s also kind of hard to use it on the grass, as you probably need bigger wheels for that. This I consider the only bad thing about the stroller.Here comes the important stuff that I\'ve learned after becoming a mom. The car seat has good rear facing capacity. What does this mean? That your child can rear face for a very long time in it (which is more than 500% times safer). My son is 9 months and still has a good 2 more inches of being in the car seat (he\'s in the 98th % for height). It is also very light-weight so it\'s not incredibly heavy on my back especially with my big baby. I love that I can also protect him from the cold weather in this one as opposed to a convertible. The harness is very easy to tighten (pinch test), as opposed to my husband\'s Graco Snug. I would like for it to have an arrow on both sides for when using it without a base (for proper incline), but that\'s something I could live with.Now let\'s talk about the bassinet. OMG! I love the bassinet, especially with all the deaths from positional asfixia, a bassinet gives me such peace of mind. When I use it with my child sitting down and he falls asleep, I just quickly turn the bassinet into a little ""bed"" and my child doesn\'t need to have his head hanging, he can just sleep completely flat. I would never in a million years buy a regular stroller without this feature. The bassinet\'s canopy is huge, which I also love. The bassinet cover is also very useful when it\'s cold.The stroller has a good size basket for your belongings. Everything is lightweight and very easy to maneuver.The only con I do have to warn you with is that 9 months later, and I still can\'t manage to become a pro at clicking in the car seat to the frame. For some reason I find it very hard, but that can just be me.Overall, this stroller is still 5 stars and I would buy it again, but maybe in a lighter color because there can always be a bug on it and with the dark colors they\'re harder to see.Hope this review helps!'}, {'header': 'Great', 'body': 'Love that it comes with everything you need!

When it comes to basically anything I do a lot of research before I make a final decision. I bought the graco duo glide double stroller back when it was on sale around Black Friday. It was fairly priced and had a lot of good reviews. My husband and I put it together. It was very easy and did not take long at all. We practiced folding it, opening and lifting it in and out of my Mazda CX 5. It just fits sideways in the back of my Mazda. I’m a smaller person and I can honestly say that this stroller is not very heavy and easy to use, I love the storage underneath too.We finally purchased the graco snugride snug lock 35 lx with click connect after narrowing it down to 3 infant graco car seats. We went to a few different stores to be able to see them in person and see how heavy they were going to be. This car seat was definitely the lightest out of all of them. It’s about 9lbs compared to 17pounds or more. The design is very sleek and soft, also it does come with a newborn insert. I also love the safetly harness and it comes with seat belt covers so that they don’t rub against their neck. After doing a little research to see how both car seats snap into the stroller, we got them in. The very front was easy to snap down onto the cup holder tray. The one closest to the back of the stroller was a bit tricky. The arm bar is actually hidden under the cup holder tray. So you have to snap that off and the arm bar is good to go to snap the car seat down on it.Overall I can’t wait to be able to use these items with our twins. I’m very satisfied with the quality so far and the easy installation.'}, {'header': 'Worth it', 'body': 'This car seat I use to have for my first born but for my second born I had gotten Baby tread and I honestly regretted it. It was so hard to take out of its base and to put it in unlike this car seat. This car seat is very easy to install and I do not have difficulty taking out the car seat out of the base. It looks very comfortable for my newborn and it had lots of cushion around it which is something I was looking for. This car seat is exactly what I should have gotten for my second born, but since I was being cheap I got what I paid for. Don’t let the price of this car seat scare you, it is worth it for your little one.

Really easy to adjust straps as baby grows. I would recommend for new parents""}, {'header': 'Amazing! Must buy car seat!', 'body': 'I’m not sure it’s normal to be this excited about a car seat, yet here I am!! I was on the hunt for a new infant car seat for our 3rd baby because our Baby Trend one always gave us fits. I originally ordered the Graco Snugride Snuglock 35 Elite. Once it came in, I hated it! The seat was bulky, the coloring on it was weird, the headrest didn’t come out, etc. Thankfully I also had this car seat already in transit as a 2nd option. And boy am I glad I did! This car seat is absolutely beautiful! I mean no disrespect when I say that it does not look like a Graco car seat! It looks like a high end car seat that I see plastered all over Instagram!Even though it’s pretty, let’s talk functions! The one button handle...game changer! As a mom of 2 toddlers with one on the way (I’ll have 3 kids 4 and under) this handle could be life changing! I can already see myself holding the baby or having my hands full with the toddlers so the one handed easy handle is awesome! The canopy is a very thing, almost spandex like material! Super breathable and unlike any car seat canopy I’ve ever seen before! I was originally worried about the seat being all black and being hot for baby but I think the canopy is a huge plus being so thin and allowing air to pass thru! The padding inside feels soft and squishy. The newborn insert is the perfect amount of support. I know which my other 2, they grew out of the infant inserts by about 2 months old and the ones that came with this seat look like they will work great as well.I couldn’t find one complaint about this car seat so far! I can’t wait to put my new little babe in it come October! Well done, Graco!'}, {'header': 'Wonderful!', 'body': 'I did a lot do research to order a car seat that would be excellent for our daughter. I’m very happy with this purchase. I feel that she is safe while we are driving.I like how it was easy to install. It’s perfect for newborns- comes with removable head padding. Her head is nice and secure. It comes with the base which is nice. I also like the feature of how the base “locks in” and it easy to take out and move to a different car. I don’t regret this purchase. Finally the button in the center of the handle is also great.Cons: I wish that the handle and the “shade/canopy” part would both come forward a little more. Sometimes we are outside in the sun and it just doesn’t extent like it should. Otherwise, we have been using it for two months and it’s been great so far.'}, {'header': 'Car seat is the bomb!', 'body': 'Perfect, supportive, safe.'}, {'header': 'Pleasantly surprised', 'body': 'It looks just like the photos and is sooo soft !

Also easy to put together and adjust as well, which means when it’s time to clean/wash it’ll be so fast too. 10/10 recommend this car seat, I’m saving mine and if I have to buy another one I'm only getting this exact one.""}, {'header': 'Super Light', 'body': 'Love that it’s super lightweight.

Other companies will be copying this one!""}, {'header': 'Very lightweight easy to carry', 'body': 'Love how lightweight this is!! Easy to attach to base.'}, {'header': 'By Far the Best Car Seat Purchase I’ve Ever Made', 'body': 'Love this car seat! I researched and fret over car seats for months. Since it has been more than 10 years since I had my last baby, a lot has changed and there’s so many more options today. I have to be honest, I did good picking this one out! The base with this seat is far superior to any base I’ve had before. There is an added feature- a lever of sorts- that ensures the base’s tightness and security. It’s a great feature. The seat itself has an amazing feel to it, which I was initially concerned with since I couldn’t feel it online. I’m so happy with this purchase. I feel my little guy is safe and comfortable. The UV canopy is an awesome feature too and the ability to change the tightness of the straps with on lever push... oh, and the change of the handle with one button push! So many things to love. The best part of all though is that this will fit into any base or stroller with Click Connect. Two minor complaints... and I mean MINOR... sometimes we struggle getting the seat out of the base. You have to make sure you’ve pulled the backed lever handle up all the way and then pull on the car seat. Secondly, I can’t put the handle all the way back like some of my previous car seat handles. This prevents the car seat from fully stabilizing in a grocery cart- so my little one is constantly rocking when in the back of a cart. Overall though, would buy again.'}, {'header': 'Best seat for price point', 'body': 'I purchased this infant seat for my second child, and I wish I had it for my first! I think you would be hard pressed to find a better car seat in this price category (especially if purchased with an Amazon Prime registry discount). I’ll just say that with our first we used the seat and base that came with our graco stroller travel system, and it was a pain to use. The base did not adjust, so we had to use a pool noodle underneath one side. The straps did not have the front pull to tighten and had to be manually adjusted in the back (for each time we were putting our son in and out of the seat!). The infant insert was useless and we used rolled up blankets around his head instead. The handle required both hands to adjust. We still used it until we upgraded to a convertible seat around 9-10 months, but it was annoying every time. This time around I was determined to get something nicer.This seat is the opposite of all those things and more! The handle requires one hand to raise and lower, the straps loosen and tighten with ease, the fabric itself is comfortable and supportive, and the base is adjustable to get the seat perfectly level. The canopy is also lovely and makes this seat look high end. It works with our old stroller too, which is a plus! I guess I didn’t know what we were missing out on before. I scoped out a lot of infant seats before I purchased this one, and hands down, for the price point, this is a fantastic choice and I am very happy.'}, {'header': 'Love this', 'body': 'This is so perfect it looks amazing and is very safe!'}, {'header': 'Love it', 'body': 'I have 4 kids. And this by far has been my favorite infant car seat. My little dude appears to be super comfortable and it’s super light weight. I was told not to lift anything heavier than my baby for six weeks postpartum. However, I’m stubborn and have not listened to all of my doctor’s recommendations. Here I am, with a 4 week old, lifting a very light car seat because I feel that I am capable of doing so. I also like the click connect feature. Worth the price & I definitely feel like my baby is safe in this car seat.'}, {'header': 'Life-saving, literally', 'body': ""My daughter was born in August 2019 and MIL wanted to buy our infant seat. I found this one, read the reviews, and instantly wanted this seat. I like how it's all black and doesn't have patterns or color scheme or anything like that. I also like how it had a lot of padding and would protect a baby in a car accident.Fast forward to Oct 22, 2019 and we were involved in a rear-end collision. We got hit at a stand still. My daughter was snug as a bug in her car seat in the middle. My car was totaled but my husband, our daughter and I literally got to walk away from the crash. Luckily our 2 year old son wasn't with us, but I am confident his Graco seat would have saved his life also. Most, if not all, of our products are Graco and I am completely content with their stuff. Insurance paid us for both seats so I went ahead and purchased another one for my daughter because...why wouldn't I?

Got another one for my second daughter in 2021. I loved how easy it was to install and it was actually tight when I was done. No wiggling around like some of the cheaper brands that I was never able to tighten to my liking. I also really appreciate the fact that when I want to move up to the next stage, I can just take my phone out and hold up to QR code on the car seat and there’s an installation video ready to help me and make sure I don’t miss anything.

This one is awesome because it grows with your baby. When they are ready to move to a larger car seat, all you have to do is peel off a layer of padding. This is also super handy if you have a little one who sometimes has blowouts from their diaper…just peel off the layer they pooped on and wash it. It’s great!Our baby seems much more comfortable in this seat than in her infant carrier. It sits her up higher, so she can see things out the window. It’s also very padded with good head support so she falls asleep quite comfortably in her car seat.It took us a little to figure out how to install the seat (mostly because we were trying to figure out the recline and such). However, once we got it all figured out, it’s as easy to install as any of Chicco’s car seats.This is also a solid and strong car seat. Thankfully, we haven’t been in any accidents, so we haven’t had to see how it does in a crash. However, that being said, my sister has been hit in her car and her littles were in this car seat. It protected and the seat itself look s fine after (although, they bought new seats simply out of an abundance of caution).While this might seem like a pricey seat, when you factor in how much it would cost to buy a new car seat at each stage, this comes our as a great deal. Overall, buying this car seat will save you money and give you piece of mind.'}, {'header': 'Awesome 4-1', 'body': ""Carseat is awesome for the money. The materials and the design are very well thought out. We tried the Evenflow Everystage first. The ratchet click was great for car seat anchors, but all other materials were poor quality especially the belts. The buckles turn on the belt straps very easily. It was very hard to pull 5 point harness tight as well. The cup holders remove way too easy. My son had those removed in 2.5 seconds so we returned it. Next we tried Graco's 4ever Dlx Platinum. The Easylatch system for car seat anchors is not good. Does not tighten up well at all, also not easy to loosen. Materials were great, but my kid didnt seem comfortable in the chair. Loosening 5 point harness is not good. Hard to locate button and hard to push it down since you have to push it through the cushion. The back of the carseat is also open making it look very unclean with all the belts exposed so we returned that one as well. So we decided to try the Chicco next and are definitely happy with it. Materials are top notch, son seems very comfortable in the seat, the back is closed making for a clean appearance, there is storage for anchors when not in use, cup holders have buttons that lock them into place and the holders are a soft plastic, the 5 point harness is easy to tighten and there is a small slit in the pad to press button easily to loosen the 5 point harness, the pads and labeling tell you exactly what you need at each stage, there is a lot more leg room as well for your child compared to the other two we tried, and the SuperCinch latch system for the anchors is awesome. Super easy and gets the car seat rock solid. By far the best latch system. It is also very easy to loosen it as well. Go with this system if you are wanting a 4 in 1 you will not be disappointed.""}, {'header': 'No Further Carseats Needed!!', 'body': ""Our youngest is 1, and I'm celebrating that we will never need to store or buy a car seat again! The idea of purchasing this car seat and not needing to buy a booster seat 3 years from now was very appealing to me, and I was not disappointed with this Chicco purchase!For being a 4-in-1 seat, I was shocked by the slim profile of the entire thing! It is actually slimmer overall than the Chicco NextFit- especially on the sides! We did not use the first stage of the seat, but I am pleased to put our son into the second stage. He is 12 months (20+ pounds) and is comfortable, secure, and protected. I changed the seat into stage 3 to see how it fits our 3 year old, and it was super easy to pull out the stage 2 cushions, to adjust the headrest, and to pop her in it! She loved it and wanted it to be her seat! I’m very happy with the design of the harness booster and booster capabilities! Our oldest (7) is in her 4th carseat (a booster), and I wish I could have purchased the 4-in-1 when she was an infant, instead of going through so many car seats!Several bonuses of the seat that I love are the ease of taking it in and out, the quality click and fold cupholders (they don’t come out when bumped or grabbed), and the ease of reclining the seat into the perfect position (I’m not limited to 1 or 2 recline positions when he is sleeping!). We love every Chicco product we have, and this 4-in-1 seat exceeded our high expectations! Thanks, Chicco!""}, {'header': 'Great for the thick babies!', 'body': 'First of all, I have large children.

Also she is constantly moving, and hates confinement and even being held. Her other car seat was a Graco and she would scream and cry every time she was in it. This car seat however has offered my wild child room to throw her legs around, and is still comfortable enough with the padding. Super bonus is the chest clip: it has a size option of narrow and wide which is great when the neck rolls are thick and those straps dig in. Installation is easy and secure, she isn’t going anywhere, and for my forgetful mom -of-2-brain the instructions are on the side of how to change from the latch to belt option, or how to secure the seat from rear to front facing.

I have a convertible one, but it\'s so huge and bulky. I\'ll be using it when my LO grows out of this one.Also, this one has a high rating on consumer reports. It\'s very safe.My LO is only 2 1/2 months and his height and weight is supposedly in the first percentile (supposedly because 23 years ago, my other son was the same size and in the 80th percentile). So, it seems that the carseats haven\'t gotten bigger when, apparently, the babies have. I\'m just worried that my LO is going to grow out of this carseat way before he\'s ready to forward face the other one. I had to adjust the seatbelt to one notch higher on the back and the inserts made him to cramped; so, I removed them. All before he\'s 3 months old. HmmmmmI got the stroller that goes with the carseat and that\'s amazing.For those of you, like me, who haven\'t used an infant seat in 20 or so years, this carseat isn\'t installed the same way as they used to be. My FJ Cruiser doesn\'t have the latch bars. So, I used the seatbelt. The difference is: this carseat says not to child-lock the seatbelt and the only way the base stays nice and stable is by putting the shoulder strap portion of the seatbelt through the plastic ledge at the top of the seatbelt hole. It locks it in place when you do that. If you don\'t do it, the base is VERY loose and dangerous. **So, please make sure it doesn\'t wiggle more than an inch.** You only need to slide into the ledge the one side that\'s opposite of where the seatbelt locks in. I hope that makes sense. If not, Google ""how to install chicco keyfit 30 with seatbelt"" and there\'s a great video that shows exactly how to do it.'}, {'header': 'Best infant car seat!!', 'body': 'The head support is absolutely amazing.

We had these for my twins, and I searched all over for another one when we found out we were pregnant again. It is the perfect balance between convenient, safe, and *light*. Emphasis on the “light!”Please check the weights on the “improved” more recent models. They are so heavy compared to the original! The whole point of the “baby bucket” style car seat is to make getting them in and out of the car easier. Every extra pound to the seat makes it less successful at that goal. The increased weight limit on the newer seats for the baby is pretty meaningless to me... who wants to be carrying and lifting a 30 pound child PLUS a heavy seat? Nobody! And many children outgrow the seats by height before they hit the weight limit anyway. The “improvements” let them increase the price and force them to increase the weight without actually improving function at all.Double check the product info for the particular model you have selected before ordering. Some of these seats are absolutely massive! Personally, I recommend the original for as long as it’s available.

This is the only car seat I have ever been comfortable installing because most others stress me out that I’m not doing it right. This one has a base that just clicks into the little metal bar all cars have standard in their backseats (check the crack if you don’t believe me) now. Then you make sure it’s pulled tight with the little strap and that the level on the side of the seat is looking level and boom it’s done. The infant seat just clicks right in and come it by lifting up while squeezing the back handle. It’s extrnely easy.I also like how easy it is to losen and tighten the straps on the baby (as opposed to the Graco that makes it SO HARD). As being able to loosen it so easily helps get baby in easier and helps make getting sleeping baby out a possibility if needed.Additionally, this seat seems to be way more comfortable for baby than other options. She has been able to sleep in it no problem and she for a while wouldn’t ever sleep anywhere else.Finally, we were in a car wreck when baby was 9 weeks old, and she was in this seat.

After using this and seeing how easy it was to install, we decided not to purchase the second base.Aside from ease of installation, the seat itself is easy to operate - easy to get in and out of base, as well as loosen and tighten the straps around my child.NOTE: Both my car and my wife's car have the LATCH (Lower Anchor and Tethers for CHildren) system, and that is how I installed the car seat in both our cars.

In short, you're going to need three strollers. Get ready to invest $500 in strollers, and call it good to go. Any less, and you'll get what you pay for. Or worse yet, try a bunch of mid-priced strollers, and still not end up with what works.The first stroller you'll need is an infant seat carrier that is incredibly lightweight and easy to fold apart and back together. I can't imagine what I would have done without my Baby Trend Snap-N-Go EX Universal Infant Car Seat Carrier. When they are tiny, you're going to spend all sorts of time lugging that infant carrier around. You literally need something that basically falls right open to toss that heavy seat in and run errands. I used this thing constantly, and it was well worth the investment.I tried other similar infant carrier holder/carseat combinations such as the Graco Modes 3 Lite DLX Stroller, Includes Reversible Seat, Pierce and Evenflo Urbini Reversi Lightweight Stroller, but they both turned out to be a huge waste of money. The Graco reversible only works with their propriety travel system car seat, and the wheels are still plastic! No matter how tempting it may seem, don't settle for a regular sized plastic wheeled stroller no matter how many gadgets it might have.The Evenflo was also great in theory, but a waste of money. Being able to interchange the carseat, and flip the baby forward and backward just does not matter all that much at all. Instead, you REALLY just need a very lightweight and portable universal infant carrier. That's all I used for the first six months of my daughter's life, because she was so little.The next stroller you are going to need is a good jogging stroller. I love my JOOVY Zoom 360 Ultralight. In theory, you can get a carseat adapter for it. It has big wheels for walking off the postpartum weight, but it is still pretty compact and lightweight. I would get the Joovy Zoom 360 Ultralight Jogging Stroller, Large Canopy, Lightweight Jogger, Extra Large Air Filled Tires instead of the original ZOOM for sure. It is absolutely worth it to get the rain cover and the bigger canopy. There is nothing worse than going on a walk with the sun in your child's eyes most of the time.That said, you're still going to need something more compact than your jogging stroller. Don't fall for the trick of getting a regular sized stroller instead. That's a huge waste of money. You already have your jogging stroller, and an infant seat carrier. When they are less than six months old, those two should do the trick. Once they get a little older, you'll need to replace that infant seat carrier with an umbrella stroller.I tried the Cosco Umbrella Stroller with Canopy stroller. Another giant waste of money. I took it through airport security, and my daughter literally fell out of it onto the ground! I left it at my destination, and opted to carry her back through security the other way. Every parent thinks they need a 'regular' stroller, but what you actually need a shopping/airport/errand running stroller for your trunk. The jogging stroller can live in your garage for when you want to get your walk/run in. This second stroller needs to live in your car where you used to keep your infant carrier. It needs to have a five point harness, but it also needs a great canopy. That's my biggest complaint about the Zoom Ultralight 360: the canopy is worthless. It makes a huge difference. You also need it to be super compact. A stroller that is for the purpose of lugging around your baby needs to be small. Trust me, you'll pay all sorts of money for a 'regular' stroller, and it will sit there in your garage unused. Either you will use your jogging stroller to power walk/run, or you'll need something for on the run. That's really it.I HIGHLY recommend Joovy Kooper Stroller, Lightweight Stroller, Compact Fold with Tray. It is the quintessential alternative to a 'regular' stroller. It fits in my subcompact Scion XD no problem, and I just push the button to unfold it in an instant. It folds right back up no problem. The trifold takes up less space than a cheap umbrella stroller. It glides through tiny aisles. There is nothing worse than trying to push a GIANT stroller in any store. This is the solution. It is way more than an umbrella stroller, but way more helpful than a 'normal' stroller. You don't need your stroller to make your baby recline, or turn around. You just need a place for a snack, a cup, a water bottle, and some shopping items below the cart. The wheels are big enough, and even though they are plastic, they are only going to be for running in and out of stores. You'll use your jogging stroller for gravel, cement, rough roads, etc. This just needs to get you in and out of the coffee shop without needing someone to help you hold the door.And there you have it!

Great price as well.'}, {'header': 'Great buy', 'body': 'I just got this in 2 days ago and have taken it for a fee test drives, so far I really like it. I wanted to specifically add pics of it folded and in my small trunk. That was one of the main pics I was looking for when going through the consumer reviews and I never found any. I have a Kia Soul that has a narrow and very small trunk. I have the baby trend skyline travel system and the stroller was way too big. I had to drive around with it on its side which prevented me from being able to use my trunk cover and made it difficult to close the trunk door. This small device fits perfectly in my trunk with a few inches of wiggle room on each side. I now have no issues using my trunk cover which I appreciate because I leave my diaper bag in the car and worried someone might break in thinking it’s something of value. The device is super light weight and I had no trouble carrying or folding it. Assembly took me about a whole 2 minutes to complete. I was a little weary about it given there were several bad reviews about the tires breaking off and the back tires not being compatible. I was happy to see all the correct parts when I unboxed it and so far have not had any issues with the tires. After looking at all the reviews it seems like the tire issues were between 2017-2019. I’m hoping the manufacture has fixed the issue since then. *however did I make a few modifications to the strap (at my own risk and discretion) because I personally did not like how it went across the car seat. My baby gets really fussy and I tend to take her in and out a lot. That strap was just annoying having to unbuckle it and then her each time. I ended up buying another buckle and installing it on the other strap so they each had a male/female part (pics included) that way I was still able to secure the car seat to the stroller but the straps are being bucked around the handle of car seat (one buckle on each side) rather than across the car seat. It works for me but obviously don’t do it if you’re not comfortable making any modifications to it. I noticed a lot of people complained that the car seat does not actually snap in to the stroller but the design of it is pretty secure. The seat just sits inside almost like a hammock but it’s very sturdy even without the straps. Overall, I am super happy with the purchase and hope it lasts long enough to get me monies worth.

I wanted a well padded seat. I wanted a simple design, especially one that would be easy to keep clean. I wanted a compact car seat. And I wanted it to fit up to 65 lb. So there was my check list. This seat checks every box. It is everything I was hoping for. My babies really like their new seats and being able face forward and look out the window. The seats are well padded and comfy. They are compact. They are a no fuss design, simple to use. And my babies are able to sleep in them! The one tip of advice I would give though: in order for my babies to sleep in them comfortably without their head going forward, I pulled the car seat forward on the seat and folded in the back stabilizing bar. The first time I used the seat with it all the way upright and against the back of the seat,their heads did flop forward when they went to sleep. But with it pulled forward the angle is perfect now. The cover is easy enough to take on and off for cleaning and I love that I can just throw the whole thing in the wash. And they are affordable!

Pretty compact in size compared to others, we have a very small vehicle (Chevy Spark) and this fits pretty well without looking very bulky. Although, it doesn’t fit in rear facing position without moving the passenger seat as far up as possible.Cons: The straps twist constantly in the bucke part. I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong, but I can’t seem to stop it from happening.'}, {'header': 'Not bulky and easy to install', 'body': 'I bought this car seat because I babysit my 11 month old niece 3 days a week and I didn’t want to struggle with the deluxe car seat that her parents have. I love the simplicity of this car seat and I am very happy with my purchase.'}, {'header': '3 across system works great!', 'body': ""I ordered 3 of these because we have a new baby on the way, and our girls' old car sets were too large to fit 3 across. Well, I am so glad I did order 3 because, as a set, they fit perfectly across the back seat of our 2015 Kia Soul. There is room for the doors to close easily, we didn't have the reclining problems that others were having, but my husband is an engineer, so that may have helped. As far as fit is concerned, our 4 year old who wears 5t clothing is super comfortable in her seat and has plenty of room to grow. We also have a one and a half year old who is just as comfortable, and I will update this review once our newborn arrives, but based on the great recline we are getting, there shouldn't be any problem with him fitting well. I couldn't recommend this system more, and also love that even though they're light weight, they were as strong as the super large, more expensive car seats our girls used to have!""}, {'header': 'Easy to install, takes up less space, don’t like the cup holder', 'body': 'I love this car seat except for the cup holder. I understand why they can’t have an incorporated cup holder because it would make this seat wider but at least allow the cup holder to properly clip in and stay secure. I can’t get the thing to clip in.Other than that the car seat is great. It has lots of padding so baby likes to lay her head against it. It’s easy to install and it fits great in the car!

My seat is a Chicco and I love love love it. This seat is very bare bones, but it’s perfect for my sitter. The size is very compact which she needs in her smaller car. It’s very padded and plush. I was surprised at how nice it was when I pulled it out of the box. The colors are great and my son feels comfortable in it. That being said, the lack of a latch really bothers me. It wasn’t as easy to install as my latch car seat, but my car seat wouldn’t have been a good option for her size wise anyways so this is great. We measured a lot of seats and this one is the most compact we found.'}, {'header': 'Comfy but small', 'body': ""We have used this for a few months now and it still looks new. It is holding up really well. I was worried about the memory foam losing its shape or becoming less firm with time, but we haven't noticed that at all. It also takes up so much less space than other car seats we looked at. We do not have any other seats in the car anymore since this is my youngest - but the extra space I notice is really nice. We are already on the second to highest shoulder strap level, so that is my biggest concern that he may outgrow it quickly - but the specifications imply he should be fine for at least a year so I guess it will depend on our growth spurts this year.""}, {'header': 'Comfortable', 'body': 'It has a lot of support and it is comfortable.'}, {'header': 'Excellent value with great safety ratings', 'body': ""This car seat is a fantastic value for the price. I purchased it for Grandma's car and while it was significantly more difficult and time consuming to install than the more expensive Chicco NextFit that I have in my car, the extra struggle was worth the savings. My baby seems quite comfortable in this car seat. Of note, I did take it to a local police station to have it inspected because I wasn't sure my installation was correct, but was told that while the car seat should not move more than 1 inch from side to side, you will be able to rock it up and down more than 1 inch even when correctly installed. Thought this was worth noting as I wasn't sure it was belted in tight enough, but the local police say many car seats are designed that way. All in all, a great buy from Cosco!""}, {'header': 'Satisfied overall!', 'body': 'Overall I really like this car seat! At first it was a little difficult to get tightened in the car but once we got that figured out and watching the YouTube video of the install it was easy.

Great safety, light and compact, comfy. The cover isn't as great of quality as high end carseats...but I can easily look past it for the savings. And it does look good, very modern. We honestly wereally about to buy the Clek fllo because we need to have the option of fitting 3 across, but someone told us about this and we read tons and tons of reviews on it. I'm totally pleased with the seat. It has one of the highest height ranges for rear facing, and that was very important to us as our kids are quite tall. The adjusting head rest is great, the whole seat is easy to install and use. We bought a second one shortly after getting one for our son, our daughter likes this seat so much better than the evenflo triumph we had previously had.""}, {'header': 'Highly recommend this car seat', 'body': 'I bought this for my parents’ house because I didn’t want to fly with my car seat upon going to visit them. I loved it so much I brought it back home with me. It’s just a comfortable, easy to use, easy to clean car seat. Smaller than some of the big car seats but lots of room. Great for that in between infant car seat and big kid car seat stage. Great for allowing more room in the back seat (we could still fit two adults in the back with this seat installed).'}, {'header': 'Great product', 'body': 'I needed new car seats for my 5 & 7 year olds before heading out on a 20 hour road trip. During this time, we traded our Ford Flex in for a GMC Yukon XL. These car seats are super comfortable, very durable, and the fabric is easy to keep clean! But they wouldn’t fit side by side in my Ford Flex. Of course they fit perfectly in my GMC Yukon XL though. If you are looking for car seats where you can fit three side by side, these will NOT work in a standard sized vehicle. Again, they didn’t fit correctly in a Ford Flex (SUV type wagon). They fit great in the Yukon side by side and I can still put the third seat in the second row down with ease.'}]","[{'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zfDauaKpL._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-1.jpg', 'checksum': '6518b30a1bd6d80c8a5f0e5e5af57986', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gtwp8zG4L._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-2.jpg', 'checksum': '08c7fdbeeb0616f94b46496e192e3bac', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SM0dDNyhL._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-3.jpg', 'checksum': 'e760bcc08732653fdaecd4386c64fd70', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+lsmN962L._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-4.jpg', 'checksum': 'c902a1f92742b9df023021e7859552dd', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yhEDUWpqL._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-5.jpg', 'checksum': 'bbd8d447fd62655a02ce936a724517bb', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hSE8KadFL._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-6.jpg', 'checksum': '12432c61250745e69fbde81a18b49bdb', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NyaV1YA5L._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-7.jpg', 'checksum': '97be980ff2a7c5402b91d3489afd6bea', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZU7DcFGxL._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-8.jpg', 'checksum': '210cb3ceddb170a2c32e8ae2ab453e09', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611UOv61xFL._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-9.jpg', 'checksum': 'c9e188c8258adfc6c5e5d52b75d0692d', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JfWHkGhBL._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-10.jpg', 'checksum': '4cbb51696483017ca530abac32b22f67', 'status': 'uptodate'}, {'url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71op-0JJFEL._SL1000_.jpg', 'path': 'Cosco-Mighty-Convertible-Seat-Heather-11.jpg', 'checksum': '384a12ca2e8a48e1aae1d5d8c8b5946c', 'status': 'uptodate'}]",,Car Seat,"B019EGMGR0,B08WJFRQ91,B00K2ZFHAG,B07S27HVLK,B09NKN9ST8,B00J3KL4HG,B079W46W4L,B07XLG6BJH,B07ZWVKR73,B00ISCPJM6,B07BB5VXBW,B01GVJ65MA,B00O9W4704,B07VHVH7YF,B08DTF8VNC,B089MJNSMW,B08Q1LS11S,B081DB6F4D,B08V3CJ85W,B09KTFYKBK,B07YNDK15M,B019EGMGNE,B004CVDQUO,B07QV3118Z,B08VZK14KZ,B00O8RRRSO,B083XVXV7L,B08RFYHMPW,B08SCNB67G,B08SCPHL1Q,B017VNNTX8,B07MC48TNP,B091B58LFD,B07QTYGYLZ,B08YQ4L4Y7,B08586LYYL,B084K44651,B08TX4K5TJ,B09382PVFM,B084K4BXHP,B07NM559VL,B09NPM265Q,B08PDLGG2L,B0938K24VC,B09311PL54,B08PDKM8HJ,B08YQ1NV6N,B0929L3HV6,B08Z2P55HM,B09881YNV8,B08398MV69,B09LKL9NWZ,B09Q7XFCH5,B095L484LJ,B07L4JPQ64,B07T25WNL3,B06XSMY6Y3,B06XG17VNF,B0728GXF8V,B07FQ6M8CR,B07N28BMB5,B08L9K2MHS,B01N6Z70BR,B087H3XJ49,B07ZS4QBVF,B0921CBPG7,B08K2GX7PP,B071VHBYX8,B09YTN79H7,B07R1CPT7Z,B07DGPGQXN,B071L1NG6N,B006PB2B6O,B08C779LF4,B07L47ZRPW,B00PTL2BE8,B07CZT4M2Y,B06VY1DFQN,B00838BNK2,B07CVCHKTT,B07HML1BT5,B07XTWM2XL,B07H8VTTCP,B07XSC4284,B01N3MYMB2,B01N3MYVZM,B01ETUBQZ4,B07XSBT57H,B07J37RTPG,B07KBPKJYT,B07XSBK4Z2,B01MRE9IOC,B0828M8G61,B07YXP3Y2Z,B07HNTTWY8,B07TGX255N,B09RNDW2LH,B01N5P7G80,B07Y5S4VWT,B07MSPMKPQ",,,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ETUBQZ4,,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gtwp8zG4L._SL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SM0dDNyhL._SL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+lsmN962L._SL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yhEDUWpqL._SL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hSE8KadFL._SL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NyaV1YA5L._SL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZU7DcFGxL._SL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611UOv61xFL._SL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JfWHkGhBL._SL1000_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71op-0JJFEL._SL1000_.jpg",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zfDauaKpL._SL1000_.jpg

It is true that they are heavy so this is not the car seat for you if you plan to remove it frequently, but for safety, Britax cannot be beat. This seat is in my car for my granddaughter and at 5 she can almost buckle herself in. We are still using the side protection, but know that eventually when she is 8 or 10 we can just use the booster part.

Our previous car seats were Dionos and it was difficult to imagine that any other car seat would be as safe. As we moved from a five point harness to a booster, it was a tough decision since many boosters are so flimsy and many do not have the latch feature. This booster not only had the latch but also had the durability we were looking for.So far, this car seat has held up for our 7 year old and she does not complain that it’s uncomfortable on long drives.It also does not slide around in the seat and the top portion is securely attached to the bottom portion. I’d say it was money well spent. I’ll update later on the longevity of this purchase.'}, {'header': 'This car seat is a breeze to install.', 'body': 'This replaced a Graco that I bought for transporting our now 6 year old grandson. We had a fender bender and the insurance company agreed to replace the car seat. This booster car seat is much lighter than the car seat we had. The little man can get in and while I like to help him get buckled, he is able to unbuckle himself when we get where are going. I like the alligator clips that are easy to use. It has two cup holders a real plus.'}, {'header': 'Perfect for my 4 year old', 'body': 'My daughter absolutely loves this car seat! She recently took her first nap in it and her head stayed upright and comfortable. She loves the two cup holders and lets her older sister use one. It was easy to install and the safety features were my biggest thing since this is her first seat since outgrowing the 5 point harness car seat.'}, {'header': 'Can’t put a price in safety', 'body': 'I did my research when purchasing a booster for my kiddo. This model has exceptional ratings as well as an additional lap point for the seatbelt, which I love. You can remove this feature once they have outgrown. It’s light and easy to move around the car when needed.I gave the comfort 4 stars because my son complains about being uncomfortable when he’s tired.'}, {'header': 'Britax always! Worth the money!', 'body': 'When it comes to car seats that is one thing we will never skimp on and always make sure we get the best of the best. Which for us, is Britax. Always. Ease of use along with safety features makes it a no braineR choice for us. (And yes, once I bought a Graco for a spare vehicle and ended up returning it for how crappy it was made - I couldn’t even get it installed!) I included these photos since people were complaining about the color. It’s grey enough to me but I could see how it could look purple in some lights? Maybe? I wasn’t worried since I have three girls ;P If you’re thinking about spending the money to get a Britax, do it. You’ll never regret spending money on a car seat but you may regret not buying the best if anything ever happened.

I haven't had it long but the quality of it is outstanding. Apparently there are not a whole lot of safety requirements around side impact but this is triple enforced on the side and comparing it to all of the other booster seats I have it clearly is a much more robust product. I feel good about this investment into my daughters safety.UPDATE: almost 9 months later and this booster is still fantastic. Looks new, no issues, easy in and out of the car. Have recommended it to multiple friends and everyone loves it.""}, {'header': 'My Child Loves This Seat', 'body': 'For me, the seat is well built, easy to install and wonderfully transportable.

However, I thought the bottom guide between the legs was going to be awesome and I used it exactly twice. It’s cumbersome to use and honestly by the time the child is in a booster like this they’re able to go without the piece. Still a great car seat, just didn’t use that piece like I thought I would.'}, {'header': 'Tons of safety features', 'body': 'This seat is beautiful. I absolutely LOVE the piece between the legs to keep the lap belt in place. It was so easy to install. Unfortunately, it wasn’t comfortable for my daughter. If the headrest was where it needed to be for proper seatbelt alignment, the head wings squished her shoulders. I really wanted to be able to keep this booster. It is so safe. And she will fit for years to come. But it simply wasn’t the right seat for her. If she isn’t comfortable, she’s not going to sit correctly which completely defeats all the safety features.'}, {'header': 'Highly Recommend this seat! Worth every penny!', 'body': 'I love this seat so much I bought 6.Two for my vehicle. Two for my Husbands and two for my Moms vehicle. I did simply so we wouldn’t have to worry about moving them back and forth and we all share a turn in riding my daughters places and I don’t want their safety to vary. I have used Britax Brand since day one with a baby carrier style then onto the five point harness, then right on up to this big seat.

I have been using this stroller now for more than 5 months and I love it, my son loves too, and my 3 yr old daughter enjoys long riding in the stroller.” She still loves the stroller since the first day she tried 🙈”. This stroller is very comfortable and very smooth. I just love the different positions that you can turn the car seat and the other seat. Another thing that I love about this stroller is that has an easy pedal break instead of two which is very easy to use. I don't have any trouble to attach the car seat into the stroller anymore, bc with a baby in it is more easy than when I tried without a baby. I definitely recommend this stroller especially if you have two young kids in a close age, instead of using two different strollers this is the perfect choice. I wish I bought this stroller when my daughter was born 3 yr ago and not to spend the money in a garbage stroller that we got for her, and wasn't worth it even a penny 🤦🏻\u200d♀️.We received this stroller today even though baby has almost three more months to come my 2 1/2 yr tried and she loved, I should say that she is not a stroller fan but she liked this one. However, the toddler seat is not big enough I wish it was a little bit bigger so she could fit easily without bending her knees. The material is really good and worth the price. The only complain that I have is that until you figure it out how to attach the car seat into the stroller is a little bit challenging, we had to try 3-4 times until we figure it out.

My son is teetering on not being able to use the sun cover on the toddler seat but otherwise the seat fits him just fine and has different foot rest settings and an attachment you can buy for 20$ thats a cup holder snack holder combo bar instead of the basic bar that comes with the stroller. The stroller itself is super easy to maneuver despite it being a double and the break is FLIP FLOP FRIENDLY!!!

This makes hauling my infant and toddler a breeze. I previously had a britax double wide stroller, and it was a bear to use. Ugh, this is soooo much nicer - it was worth every penny. I highly recommend this.This is basically an affordable version of the Uppa Baby Vista. If you think you are going to have more than 1 child within a few years of each other, I highly, highly recommend this stroller. Don't waste time or money buying a single stroller. The beauty of this stroller is that it is so easy to convert to a double without taking additional room. The infant bucket is lightweight and roomy enough to hold a larger baby - which is a big plus for us. My infant outgrew the Britax Bsafe 35 really fast - but baby is comfy in the Evenflo seat, which is great. This bucket seat is also lighter than the Britax bucket, which makes transfers much easier. I was a little worried because some of the reviews said the seats were wobbly, but I haven't had that problem. Once the infant bucket is attached it is sturdy. My toddler has no problem climbing in and out of the toddler seat. I wish the stand on board was available - I'm so sad it's sold out.Pros:* Extremely lightweight.* Easy to arrange the toddler chairs & multiple ways to arrange - kid can face in or out. Easy to clip on the toddler seat* Very compact - it fits easily in the very tiny trunk of my car* Easy to fold* Giant basket underneath holds a ton of crap - even a balance bike + park bag + park blanket* Easy to steer* Brake is easy to apply, take off with your foot*Adjustable handlebar*No additional attachments needed to clip on the infant seat or toddler seat - it's all built in, which is much nicer than having to hunt around for the attachment/s, you're never stranded without the piece you need.*infant bucket seat is big enough to hold bigger babies for longer.Cons:* Be careful not to pinch your finger when you fold it (ouch!)* Clipping in the infant seat attachment can take a little finesse - but once it is in correctly, it is sturdy.

We also purchased an extra seat so the newborn can lay in it if we don't want her in the car seat, like for trips to the zoo. It's also nice to use as a single stroller when needed. The ride is smooth. The stroller is a bit bulky, but understandable due to the expandability. Folding the stroller is easy without the seats attached (haven't figured out how to fold with seats attached). The wheel base is wider than other strollers so not as easy to maneuver as smaller strollers, but still good. Assembly was super easy. I hesitated for a month to spend so much money on a stroller, and I shopped for other options to fit three children. This is the only option on the market and is well worth the money. My husband thought I was crazy for spending so much, but now he says this stroller is a lifesaver when he takes all three kids to appointments by himself.

I’ve always felt that the car seats and strollers in the systems were a cheaper quality and this feels very high quality.I have an 18 month old that’s 30 inches and close to 30 lbs and she fits into the seat well and sits comfortably.My 3 week old was 6lb 7oz at birth and fit well in the seat. With my older two I had trouble finding an infant seat that was comfortable to them and ended up using convertible seats pretty early on. This seat seems super comfortable to her. She doesn’t cry at all and the insert doesn’t seem to put her in an awkward or bunched position like most others tend to do.Some others have mentioned difficulties with unlatching the infant seat from the base and stroller and jostling baby while connecting seat to stroller....I can see where there is a learning curve with this seat and my only tiny complaint would be the long strap at the feet that’s for tightening the seat straps gets in the way of the base sometimes and it causes it to be difficult to unlatch if it gets stuck under the seat. I always make sure to hold it out of the way when latching. And i have to double pump the release handle to get the easiest unlatch. As far as attaching to stroller, we’ve had zero issues with that and it doesn’t jostle her too much unless I’m just having problems lining it up correctly which isn’t often.I would definitely buy this system even if you only have one child currently and plan to have another. It’s perfect and very classy looking.'}, {'header': 'Best thing for 2 kids', 'body': 'Super easy to assemble. Feels strong and all the realese work smoothly.

It doesn’t come with a second seat it comes with only the car seat and first seat, you have to buy the second one and I’m excited to have both seats now for my walks and jogs and simply going to the store.

Other than that I love it! Worth every penny!'}, {'header': 'More positives than negatives, which is great!', 'body': 'First impressions of this stroller are very positive. Unboxing was very simple and my husband was able to have it up and functional within 30 minutes! It’s a beautiful stroller, pictures really don’t do it justice. Very comparable to higher end strollers such as city select or uppababy in my opinion. But for an Evenflo, I’m very impressed. I absolutely LOVE how large the basket is, and the fact that even with both the toddler seat and infant seat in there is ample room to grab things from the bottom. It is also extremely easy to fold and to turn either into a single or double seat. As a stay at home parent that is a HUGE win for me because I don’t wish to be fighting with a stroller every single time.Now for the negatives:- the wheels are not my favorite. After assembling the stroller we went out for a walk and on our first break we notice one of the tires already had a hole punched in it from who knows what. We were walking on city sidewalks the entire time so we were surprised that the hole showed up after just walking 15 minutes. That’s a bummer, and I’m hoping Evenflo will offer replacement wheels eventually as I’m sure we will need to be replacing them before it’s first year of use is complete.- The infant seat seems to be more cumbersome to attach to the adapters when compared to the toddler seat. It may just take some getting used to but it’s almost always a fight trying to get the infant seat attached and/or turned around.Overall, my husband and I are very please with the purchase!

The most surprising thing is how easily I can push and maneuver it with just one hand even with both kids in it! The frame folds up to be pretty compact, but you need to remove the ""big kid"" seat before you do so, or it becomes heavier and bulkier. The brake is a singular, push pedal that can be worked using any type of shoe and there is a massive amount of storage underneath the seats.

I drive a Nissan Versa note (very small and compact) so having a car seat that I could use rear facing for as long as possible was the most important factor. This car seat, even when reclined all the way, still allows me to fit in my drivers seat. The only space issue is the width of the seat. If I install it in the center seat then there is almost no room on either side for another adult. When installed on either side it leaves enough room for one person to comfortably sit. It’s perfect for us because we are a family of three but definitely something to consider.The absolute game changer has been how comfortable this car seat has been for my child. I live in a city with heavy traffic and I also travel to a neighboring city which is two and a half hours away regularly and my daughter has not once had a meltdown in her car seat. Yes you read that right, in one year of use NOT ONE meltdown. She just turned two and is in the 70th percentile for height but still can comfortably ride rear facing.All in all this is a great car seat and I cannot believe I waited so long to buy it. The only regret I have is not going with the zipper version for easier washing but tbh it doesn’t make it or break it for me.'}, {'header': 'Best car seat we have owned', 'body': 'This car seat is heavy, but safe! The instillation is so easy and the tight fit is amazing! We love this seat so much we have purchased two of the exact same seat.'}, {'header': 'Solid & Stylish', 'body': ""Solid carseat construction. Feels like it would hold up well in a major accident. There is a learning curve to installing, but once it's in, the carseat does not wiggle or flop around. Feels very safe. No strap holders though, so getting child in can be a bit of a struggle as you dig around under child for buckles and straps. Those can be bought, but it'd be nice if they were included. I like the easy, zippered cover. Easy to take off and clean. Detachable cup holders come off too easily, but we have managed to keep track of them by storing them in our center console and only bringing them out when needed. Overall, a good buy for us. I have 4 children, and this is by far my favorite carseat we have ever had.""}, {'header': 'Wow, this seat is a TANK!', 'body': ""Delighted with this seat; purchased it to replace a 6 year old Graco MyRide 65 that is nearing its expiration date. If you are considering keeping an expired car seat, do keep in mind that one of the key reasons to replace a seat is the advance in technology and safety features - and this seat has it all.it's amazingly easy to adjust the harness straps - just a pull on the height adjustment does everything. No more need to remove the seat from the car and disassemble it to feed the straps through higher openings. The crotch strap is quite easy to adjust as well.The LATCH grips are amazing and the Cinch to Fit system is just fantastic. Installed in my mid-sized SUV, this seat does not move even a fraction of an inch.It did take about 45 minutes to adjust the seat cushions, straps, headrest and recline to fit the seat to my granddaughter, but following the manual carefully, it was a very easy process. The seat fits very well in my vehicle - based on other reviews I was concerned it might be too big, but that's not the case at all.Yes, the seat is quite heavy - much heavier than the MyRide, which is also a bulky seat, so this probably won't move from vehicle to vehicle very often. That's the only drawback I can identify. However, for us, it's a very reasonable tradeoff for the high degree of protection that this seat will likely provide.I'm hoping never to have to test the seat's capacity to keep a little one safe in a crash, but I do have great confidence that all will be well based on how rugged and well-constructed it is, and all of the updated safety features that it carries.""}, {'header': 'Great car seat to extend rear facing for chunky babies!', 'body': 'Overall wonderful car seat. Easy install, extended rear facing, and comfy wide seat for my chunky baby. It is bigger than I expected in my 2004 Subaru. It only fits behind the passenger seat and leaves very little leg room for the adult passenger.'}, {'header': 'Best purchase I’ve made.', 'body': 'Started out with the Chicco KeyFit 30 and loved it. My sister (also using the KeyFit 30) was unfortunately recently in a serious accident with her 8 month old in the car and her KeyFit didn’t even budge during the incident. My precious nephew had not a scratch, bruise or pain to speak of. So we are indebted to the company and loyal to the Chicco brand. Rated to 30 lbs or 30 inches, our super tall kiddo out grew the KeyFit 10 lbs early! So we upgraded to the Nextfit Zip Max and I can’t brag about this seat enough. Not only does it look really sharp and offer some seriously great comfort features (like the premium cushiony materials, shoulder pads and buckle pad), but it is one of the most secure-fitting seats i’ve ever seen. There is almost no movement at all, whether you’re testing from the belt path or the seat top (which is generally not recommended due to the natural movement that can be expected, as physics goes). Even compared to the KeyFit, the install is very secure. I love the leg room this seat boasts (and so does she). And the reclining feature (which wasn’t really a selling point to me initially) is a real life saver! I adjusted it too far upright, her head tipped forward when she slept and even short trips were a nightmare. After a simple adjustment (in the gas station parking lot because I couldn’t take it anymore), I found the magic number and Lights Out! Now all trips are a breeze! Thus far, we are only using it in rear facing mode so I can’t speak to the convertibility, but we are loving the comfort, flexibility and most of all SAFETY this seat provides! It’s expensive but worth every penny!'}, {'header': 'You N E E D it', 'body': 'The Cadillac of car seats.Yes, this car seat is a bit more pricey, but hear me out.We initially bought this when my son turned a year old. Absolutely loved everything about it he sat comfortably in it, super easy and roomy while he was still rear facing and it’s SO EASY TO CLEAN!!!! You just unzip the cover and it pops right out.. no need to fiddle with annoying straps and trying to remember how things went back together. That had me sold until recently.We were in a really bad car accident, on the side that my son was on. Someone pulled out in front of us and we hit them. Our car was totaled but my son was perfectly safe and completely unharmed. I will be purchasing this car seat for all the future babies I have and will recommend it to anyone and everyone. Make the purchase, you won’t regret it! I cannot recommend this car seat enough! Remember, you get what you pay for. A $99 car seat sounds great, but I doubt it would have held up as good as this one did in our accident. I didn’t hesitate to purchase another one after the accident to replace the old one... seriously the best of the best right here!!'}, {'header': 'Super comfortable and easy to install!!', 'body': 'When my son outgrew his Britax infant seat I did hours of research and finally settled on the Graco Extend2fit based on its great reviews and moderate price. I absolutely hated it, and my son would scream the entire time he was strapped in it. I could never seem to get a good fit in either the seat itself or for my 1 year-old, 22 lb son.Next I tried the Britax Boulevard ClickTight with ARB. I have always exclusively used Britax car seats with my other children and had high hopes for this one. My car has second row bucket seats and this particular seat is HUGE! Once again, I could not get this seat to fit appropriately and unfortunately had to return it.I continued my search and for some reason this Chicco seat doesn’t come up on many “safest or best convertible car seat” lists but does get great reviews on Consumer Reports so I decided to give it a try. I could tell at once this seat would be different-it just looked super comfortable and my son did not fuss or cry when I put him in to try it. I then went to install it and this was the only seat I could install by myself and let me tell you it is rock solid—the installation of this car seat is amazingly simple and it really does take a quick pull of each latch strap. I did have to use a foam child seat positioner to get adequate recline, but the fit is perfect now!! Fits great in my bucket seats and my son loves it!!! Also seems to be one of the safest so I could not be more pleased with this purchase!!! Thank-you Chicco and Amazon!!'}, {'header': ""My second time purchasing this seat, wouldn't use any other"", 'body': 'I bought this for my Grandson and when the expiration date came due, I bought a new one. Hated to get rid of my perfectly fine seat but I am very cautious and would not want to take a chance. I would never dream of purchasing any other brand. The ease of the reclining feature is AMAZING. The comfort level for my precious boy is perfection. The peace of mind I have knowing he will be safe is priceless. It\'s a HEAVY seat, so I would say it\'s best to purchase this in a situation where you are not constantly moving it in and out of your vehicle (the way some people do when they ""share"" the car seat between care giver\'s cars and such)'}, {'header': 'Fan favorite', 'body': 'Well rated and seems safe. I like the curved nature around the head. Not as large as some other options that we looked into which was a plus. Fits in the middle seat of our Mazda cx-5 which is great because my husband and I are tall and felt squished when it was behind the passenger seat. We upgraded from a Chico key fit 30 and like that the straps and clips are the same. Always pulls out evenly when adjusting the straps. It’s easy to install (meter on side says if you’ve got it in correctly). Zip off function has come in handy when my son has had a blow out, spilled milk, etc. It’s so easy to clean and reassemble. I let it air dry overnight and it’s ready to go the next day. Also, my son is in the 94% for height at 19 months and this feet are just touching the seat. We love it.'}, {'header': 'Love this car seat!!', 'body': 'Can’t speak to how it holds up in a crash but this seat has great features. I love that you can choose how far to recline it, there is storage for the handbook, and it’s super easy to install.

Was rear ended in an accident and had to replace them so of course I replaced them with the same thing. These truly are awesome and can fit for every phase of your child's life. Infant, to rear facing baby, to front facing toddler, to booster with a back, to a regular booster. Just fantastic. My only beef with these is that once the cup holders are in, they are IN. If you need to wash them you better just do it while they are in the seat. I have taken screws out of places to try to get the cup holders free, and never again lol. Vacuum forever is my new motto after that adventure. If you want something awesome and safe, this is the car seat you want!""}, {'header': 'Caution if you transition from a no cushion infant carrier', 'body': ""******Update**************I have changed this from 4 stars to 5. There are several reviews stating that the legs are too tight (by the crotch buckle)...we noticed this too, which is why I originally gave it 4 (I could see my son was uncomfortable). I had seen the previous review about the crotch buckle being double looped and made sure my husband undid that before installing it. Well, his little legs still seemed like they were pinned down when we buckled him, so I told my husband we needed to take it out to double check that the crotch buckle wasn't still double looped (even though he swears he undid it).Well, it turns out that the latch strap that goes across the bottom of the seat under the seat cushions to use the latch system was pinning the crotch buckle down, making it too tight once installed in my SUV. So, we just had to take the crotch buckle and thread it under the latch strap so that it was on the other side of it (then thread it back through the seat cushions), that way, when we used the latch system to put it back in the SUV, it wasn't pinning the buckle down when we tightened it.I hope this helps!!!! My son LOVES his car seat now! <3I really like this car seat....my son however, had other feelings about it :\\We just transitioned my 6 month old into this car seat, because he was getting to long for his infant carrier (91% in height). I really like the fact that this car seat had more head cushion to keep his head from falling to the side when he falls asleep ( a problem we had in the Graco click connect infant carrier....we had to remove the infant insert by 1 month because he was too big for it). My son HATED the extra cushion. He was used to feeling more free, I guess, so he pitched a fit the first WEEK we had him in this seat. He would scream and push at the head cushion until he finally passed out from exhaustion :\\Also, the harness straps where they come across his legs hit at kind of a funny angle, almost like they pin his thighs down.He hasn't screamed at all this week though, so fingers crossed he's getting used to it! I haven't used the leg extender yet, will update then.I love that this is the only seat he'll need until he's completely out of car seats and boosters. The color is great and gender neutral.""}, {'header': 'Saved my daughter in an accident', 'body': 'The car seat has grown very well with my child from infancy over the last 3 years. She’s a tall girl and it has fit her perfectly at every stage.. especially with the added leg room. It’s very easy to adjust to her specific needs and secures into the car very well. It does take a while to install, but I don’t mind taking a few extra minutes to install her seat securely and know she’s safe. The car seat is a little heavy but it’s quality and safety features easily makes up for that.My daughter and I were in a pretty bad accident that totaled our car. The impact was directly where she was sitting and was hard enough to spin our car in a full circle and a half and even popped the tail light out on the other side of my car. Her car door also split in half internally. All my daughter walked away with is a bruise with carpet burn over it on her forehead where she hit the side impact cushion. She’s had bruises worse than this from falling while playing. Her car seat didn’t even budge at all. It stayed completely secured even through such a hard impact. Doctors at the ER were even blown away that a bruise was all she had after looking at photos. I am beyond thankful for this seat!We replaced her seat with the exact same one and didn’t even think twice!'}, {'header': 'All around winner! 🥇', 'body': 'We have the extend2fit 3 in one and decided to upgrade to this when my mom\'s carseat maxed it\'s rear facing do that she could have ours and this one is even nicer than the original. It has all the great features of the 3 in one includes the cup holders that my daughter can actually reach and use comfortably, a bottom buckle that fits so much more comfortably than any other brands we\'d tried and an easy to adjust height that makes securing her when she has a growth spurt a breeze rather than a hassle of rethreading. She loves that it comes with shoulder strap pads since we don\'t use any aftermarket products. And the chest clip\'s side pinch design makes it easier to unbuckle than others that use a front push button buckle. Overall, we love this seat and so does she. She\'s never once complained of being uncomfortable or not wanted to get into it. And it\'s simultaneously great on leg room for her and small enough to allow my 6\'1"" boyfriend to have enough room to sit comfortably in our small Ford focus without his seat back touching it.'}, {'header': 'Great car seat!', 'body': 'Absolutely in love with this car seat already. Felt like a kid on Christmas morning when I got to come home and open it up today. Surprisingly lightweight compared to our previous travel system base and carrier. Padding is super comfy feeling and seems pretty breathable. My son is 4 months old and super tall, 23 1/4 inches at birth so his legs dangled off the end of his carrier. He absolutely HATED his carrier car seat. Cried and screamed 90% of the time we were in the car. Put him in it today for the first time and HE FELL ASLEEP! Night and day difference. Owner manual is kind of difficult to follow sometimes but YouTube helped a lot. Only think I have noticed being a downside so far it oh my gosh that sucker is hard to install. Thankfully with the bubble level it will tell you when it’s in the right position but using the latch system it take a lot to get it to not moving more than an inch when pulling on it. Like I had to sit in it and push down while my boyfriend pulled. Other than that though already in love with this car seat. So thankful that my son can now ride rear facing longer all the while having a reliable car seat to last him until he’s older. Great job Graco!'}, {'header': 'Wonderfully safe car seat', 'body': 'We bought this car seat for the safety and because our son is large/tall for his age. It seems comfortable for him, although he seemed to hate it with the extra padding (I think it made him too hot). He was happy once we removed the first layer of padding. I will say it’s hard to utilize the extended foot rest in the rear facing position, so I’m not sure the 50 lb rear facing weight limit would be reached by many. I didn’t install the seat, my husband did, but he didn’t seem to think it was too complicated. The number 1 reason I’m adding this review, though, is because we were in a car accident this weekend. You buy a highly safe seat with the hopes that you won’t need those features, but we were so glad that we chose this seat. I was injured in the accident, but my son, who was in the Graco 4Ever E2F seat was perfectly fine! Our car is totaled but the car seat held up great and, most importantly, our son is safe! (We will, of course, be getting a new seat since it was in an accident to be safe, but there was no visible damage to it) I can’t rave about this seat enough now - it did it’s most important job perfectly and I am so thankful!!'}, {'header': 'Perfect for our boy!', 'body': 'As a certified Child Passenger Safety Technician, I bought this seat for multiple reasons. First of all, my son (7 months) is big for his age (95+ percentile for height/weight since birth) and I was concerned I would have to move him forward facing in the future while he is still young since all other seats have a rear facing limit of 40lbs. This seat’s rear facing limit is 50lbs as you know, and also has the adjustable leg room and height. Exactly what we need! I also love the cushions. This is much more comfortable looking than his Graco Snugride infant carrier and keeps his head in place with the thick cushions. Most of the complaints I’ve read from the reviews (leg area too tight) are things that can actually be fixed IF YOU READ THE OWNERS MANUAL thoroughly. We had a hard time getting this seat tight enough in the middle seat of my SUV with the seat belt (just wasn’t a good fit with the narrow seat), so ultimately we moved to an outer seat and my husband installed it very tight with the LATCH system since my SUV doesn’t allow LATCH used in the middle seat (again, you have to read owners manuals). I love how easy Graco has made the seat and the installation. They have taken a complex seat and made everything about it super user-friendly. I highly recommend this seat and if you’re having trouble, please look up Child Passenger Safety techs in your area so they can help install the seat safely for your child.'}, {'header': 'Very happy about the purchase so far though', 'body': 'I was a little surprised as to how big it was. I figured it would have plenty of room in my Buick Enclave, but when it\'s reclined down in to the 1 position it is actually a really tight fit! Please know though that I am 5\'9"" so my seat is back a decent ways, and it wouldn\'t fit if my husband moved the seat back to where he usually does for his 6\'5"" frame! It will definitely work though, especially as the recline the position up as baby gets older. I haven\'t had baby in it yet (due in two weeks) but the padding is very soft. The only thing I didn\'t see that I was wanting was little slots for the clips to go in while putting baby in. It does in fact have these, which I was very excited to find out! I have been driving around with it in the car for about a week and have yet to notice any of the rattling that people have mentioned. The only thing I saw that could be causing this was the top latch connected to the top back of the seat, which I am not using yet being rear facing. It was kind of a loose fit, so I unstrapped it and tucked it in to the pocket on the back of my seat. However, I plan on trying it how it is supposed to be to see if that makes a rattle.

At 3 years old, about 40 pounds, and TALL, other seats were dangerous. (Hypermobility Joint Syndrome.)This seat allowed him to safely rear-face until he hit 50 pounds and had to turn forward.As a rear-facing seat: it was comfortable for even the biggest little guy, with breathable fabric, awesome legroom, cup holders in reach. I love how tightly it installs. It’s not the easiest to properly install, but not the hardest either.As a forward facing seat: much easier to install than rear facing. I love the lock off clip that gets that little extra tighten. The straps are easy to tighten and loosen on this model, compared to the regular Extend2fit, which is super hard.All in all, this is a great seat for our needs.

Well insurance gave me money to re order and when i ordered the Manufactoring date of the “new car seat” was only 3 months newer then my one i replaced.

It is worth every penny knowing she is safe. My husband, who works in aviation, is thrilled that it’s FAA approved. It’s so comfortable feeling with all the padding, my daughter never protests being put in it. We added our own strap pads for our daughter’s comfort since she has the chubbiest cheeks that rub against the pads, so ours are softer. Honestly, I recommend this car seat to anyone and everyone.

Perfect.4. 2 cup holders. Might not seem like a big deal but it really is. Holds so much more than just a drink.5. The safety of course is my biggest concern and I feel safe knowing I can correctly install it on my own (I’m a single mom) and that it’s tight and won’t move and my children are safe. My 2 1/2 year old (she’s tiny) is still rear facing alongside my 6 month old and it’s great.

She tends to prefer to sit with the bottoms of her feet together versus her legs stretched out. She likes it that she can do both comfortably. The only thing she doesn't like is that her head hangs down onto her shoulder when she falls asleep. I know that all of the toddler car seats allow a lot of head room versus the infant car seats. So, I'll look into getting her something to make her more comfortable for when she chooses to nap in the car seat. Otherwise, we both love this car seat. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAR SEAT.

Fortunately, my daughter was completely unscathed. I truly believe that had I had another car seat or had my daughter not been rear facing that she would have been gravely hurt. After the wreck, I bought this exact same car seat as a replacement. When I originally bought this car seat it was $350. When I repurchased it again after our accident it was about $320.

The Maxi Cosi Pria 85 goes to 85 pounds harnessed. that’s the size of a 8 year old. not sure about height. That is however always outgrown prior to weight. What you want from your child before moving to a HIGH BACK belt positioning booster IS: No slouching or leaning over in the seat They need to have bent knees at end of booster, their legs shouldn’t be straight out due to them being too small. They need to be able to be large enough for the chest buckle to cross over their chest and make contact with the shoulder at the lowest height position for the chosen booster! AND the lap buckle should not rest on their stomach! It should be over the upper thighs. The child should be 49 inches tall (minimum in my book!) because this is when they exceed the limits for most five point harness seats. And they MUST be 40 pounds. Not 30 pounds. Not 36 pounds. FOUR ZERO. 40. If you have a 49 inch, 40 pound 3 year old who meets these, by all means move them.

What you want from your child before moving to a HIGH BACK belt positioning booster IS: No slouching or leaning over in the seat They need to have bent knees at end of booster, their legs shouldn’t be straight out due to them being too small. They need to be able to be large enough for the chest buckle to cross over their chest and make contact with the shoulder at the lowest height position for the chosen booster! AND the lap buckle should not rest on their stomach! It should be over the upper thighs. The child should be 49 inches tall (minimum in my book!) because this is when they exceed the limits for most five point harness seats. And they MUST be 40 pounds. Not 30 pounds. Not 36 pounds.

From your first ride together coming home from the hospital to soccer day car pools, the 3-in-1 Grow and Go Car Seat will give your child a safer and more comfortable ride. Featuring extended use at each stage, this convertible car seat is designed to last through all your firsts with your child.  For newborns to growing toddlers, the Grow and Go can be used in the rear-facing position from 5-40 pounds. It includes two comfortable grow-with-baby pillows to give your new travel companion a snug fit, and they easily remove as your baby outgrows them.  In forward-facing mode, the Grow and Go keeps your child protected in a harness up to 65 pounds. In both rear-facing and forward-facing mode, harness holders keep the harness in an open position. This makes it easier for you to get your child in and out of the car seat. No more fishing for the harness and clips from behind your child &ndash; they&rsquo;re right there when you need them. The QuickFit&trade; Harness offers additional convenience in both of these stages by letting you adjust the height of both the headrest and harness in one easy step, making it simple to give your growing child the best fit.  When your child is ready to use the vehicle seat belts, remove the harness to use the Grow and Go 3-in-1 Car Seat in belt-positioning booster mode: up to 100 pounds. The headrest still adjusts easily, letting you get the best fit for your child.  As your tiny baby grows into a big kid, messes are bound to happen, but the Grow and Go car seat pad makes cleanup easy. Machine washable and dryer safe, it is also designed to come off the seat easily, with no need to remove the harness. The Grow and Go is designed to provide more comfort to parents too. It takes up less room when placed rear-facing, giving up to 7 inches more leg room for parents in the front seat.

When we contacted this company simply to inquire about replacement straps we were informed that they do not make replacement straps for this specific model. So we figured, oh well this is a tragedy, but our fault. We didn\'t read about this feature, we left the sunroof open, right? That\'s not how ""safety 1st"" saw the situation at all. Instead they took this as a chance to go ABOVE AND BEYOND what anyone would expect a carseat company to offer in this situation. They wanted our son to be safe in our car. So they sent us a brand new carseat. Asking nothing of us but to destroy the old carseat to make sure no child would be unsafe in a substandard version of their seat. 10 days later, a brand new car seat showed up. And now we can throw out the old one. So to be clear, I bought this seat, by my own fault I ruined, and safety 1st still felt obligated to help us keep our son safe, living up to their name!!!! And I\'m buying stock in their company the next chance I get.'}, {'header': 'Easily grows with kids, feels safe, own 4 now', 'body': ""I really enjoy these car seats.

In our state you have to rear face till they are 2 at the earliest but we knew we wanted to rear face till the max weight limit to be safe.After getting the Extend2Fit we were able to rear face her till she was almost 3 when she hit the max weight. Now she is almost 4 and is quite tall for her age (about the size of the average 6 year old.) The Extend2Fit is only rated for forward facing untill 65Ibs and our daughter is close to the 50Ibs mark.Knowing this and that probably by the time she's 6 she'll be in a booster, and we were now needing a second car seat for our second vehicle, we finally bought this one!Truth be told it was on our radar when we bought the Extend2Fit but due to pricing and the fact that it wasn't sold at Walmart in store we got that instead.I wish I bought this much sooner. I love that in comparison to the Extend2Fit the covering is so much easier to take off and clean (The Extend2Fit cover is an absolute nightmare to take off!!)The cup holders are removable which will make cleaning much easier as my daughter likes to put food in the cup holders and leave it (which is mildly frustrating but it's her seat.)I think the only con I can see is the installation being slightly different and confusing. As the way the instructions are written there is somehow a difference between Latch and RIGHTlatch system for forward facing (but I see literally NO difference.) And the manual doesn't explain that well in my opinion which is slightly alarming as it makes a lot of room for error here.It describes 2 ways to use latch system in forward facing mode and 1 of the ways the manuel says you can't use latch in forward facing mode over 45Ibs but with RIGHTlatch mode you can. I don't like using the seat belt to hold the seat because it NEVER feels secure enough for my liking and the way my Jeep seats are it doesn't sit as well in the seat as the Extend2Fit does as the base of the seat is wider.Other than the issue of installation I think this is a decent seat. We loved our Extend2Fit and would have bought this one instead but weren't in the financial position we are now to get one. Compared to other seats similar to this, this one is incredibly affordable especially for the length of use you can use it for. I do wish to see this available in stores instead of only online however!""}, {'header': 'Cannot recommend this enough! Love it', 'body': 'I have 2 of these. Amazing car seat, lots of room, recommend to everyone bc they are so safe. I never worry about my baby in these car seats. They do generate a bit of heat when my daughter is using it but nothing terrible and I feel like that’s a common issue with any thick/safe car seat or at least most. They are big, so be prepared for that. I have a Mazda CX-5 and I do have to move the passenger seat up a little for the car seat to fit but it’s worth it. The only thing I would want from this seat is mostly esthetic and that is lighter colors for the more girly colors for the main car seat not just the infant insert and that may help with heat generation.'}, {'header': 'Great carseat', 'body': 'My son and I were in a serious accident today, I purchased this car seat when I purchased my car and I am very impressed with how the carseat protected him.

The anchor clips that attach to the are new and improved to the point I wasn’t angry at them. I was excited. They clip in super easily and can be removed in matter of seconds. They are so much better than the old ones that you have to pinch into place that can’t be seen and hope your fingers aren’t to big to separate it later.The cushions/padding comes off super easy to clean with is awesome after a road trip or an accident in the car.

I purchased the Graco 4Ever Snuglock 4 in 1 car seat due to the various positive reviews on Amazon. I mainly got this because I wanted to be minimal and did not want a separate infant car seat and toddler car seat. I thought I’d add some specificities that may not be covered by other reviews which I wanted answers for when I had my preemie daughter.1. Yes it is preemie approved. My daughter was born premature and had to stay at NICU. She was discharged at 4lbs and we took this car seat in for the 90 minute car seat test. She passed first try. The lower limit of this car seat is 4lbs which she thankfully met. We drove her back in a 45 minute drive a few days later and she didn’t fuss during the trip.2. The nurse at the hospital was not familiar with this car seat initially and asked us for the base. There is no separate base. The whole car seat is literally it. Eventually she found another nurse that knew how to configure this seat and so we didn’t have issues using this car seat to take our baby home.3. It is really easy to install (Toyota Corolla). My husband said it took a couple minutes just to install it in place before we took our baby home. We installed it in the middle of our back seat.4. Please leave the shoulder inserts on. The nurse initially took it off because she said it’s too thick but the belt was scratching my daughter’s neck on our drive home so I had to use my fingers to open a gap where her neck was. She was so much more comfortable the next day when we put the inserts back on to take her to her pediatrician. We have since brought her for car rides and she has had no issues with the seat.I’d purchase this again in a heartbeat.'}, {'header': 'Super easy', 'body': 'Impressed with how easy it was to install.'}, {'header': 'Excellent baby car seat', 'body': 'Very nice easy to use love the grow up feature only car seat You’ll ever need!'}, {'header': 'We love this seat!!', 'body': ""My son was going to outgrow the limits on his infant seat soon so I've been researching and looking at all in one carseats.

Then children should ride forward-facing, using the built-in harness system for as long as possible until they reach the maximum forward-facing weight or height for their car seat. At that point, children should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat. A booster is no longer needed once the vehicle seat belt fits properly, typically when they reach 4 feet 9 inches tall and are between ages 8-12.

In our state you have to rear face till they are 2 at the earliest but we knew we wanted to rear face till the max weight limit to be safe.After getting the Extend2Fit we were able to rear face her till she was almost 3 when she hit the max weight. Now she is almost 4 and is quite tall for her age (about the size of the average 6 year old.) The Extend2Fit is only rated for forward facing untill 65Ibs and our daughter is close to the 50Ibs mark.Knowing this and that probably by the time she's 6 she'll be in a booster, and we were now needing a second car seat for our second vehicle, we finally bought this one!Truth be told it was on our radar when we bought the Extend2Fit but due to pricing and the fact that it wasn't sold at Walmart in store we got that instead.I wish I bought this much sooner. I love that in comparison to the Extend2Fit the covering is so much easier to take off and clean (The Extend2Fit cover is an absolute nightmare to take off!!)The cup holders are removable which will make cleaning much easier as my daughter likes to put food in the cup holders and leave it (which is mildly frustrating but it's her seat.)I think the only con I can see is the installation being slightly different and confusing. As the way the instructions are written there is somehow a difference between Latch and RIGHTlatch system for forward facing (but I see literally NO difference.) And the manual doesn't explain that well in my opinion which is slightly alarming as it makes a lot of room for error here.It describes 2 ways to use latch system in forward facing mode and 1 of the ways the manuel says you can't use latch in forward facing mode over 45Ibs but with RIGHTlatch mode you can. I don't like using the seat belt to hold the seat because it NEVER feels secure enough for my liking and the way my Jeep seats are it doesn't sit as well in the seat as the Extend2Fit does as the base of the seat is wider.Other than the issue of installation I think this is a decent seat. We loved our Extend2Fit and would have bought this one instead but weren't in the financial position we are now to get one. Compared to other seats similar to this, this one is incredibly affordable especially for the length of use you can use it for. I do wish to see this available in stores instead of only online however!""}, {'header': 'Cannot recommend this enough! Love it', 'body': 'I have 2 of these. Amazing car seat, lots of room, recommend to everyone bc they are so safe. I never worry about my baby in these car seats. They do generate a bit of heat when my daughter is using it but nothing terrible and I feel like that’s a common issue with any thick/safe car seat or at least most. They are big, so be prepared for that. I have a Mazda CX-5 and I do have to move the passenger seat up a little for the car seat to fit but it’s worth it.

I thought I’d add some specificities that may not be covered by other reviews which I wanted answers for when I had my preemie daughter.1. Yes it is preemie approved. My daughter was born premature and had to stay at NICU. She was discharged at 4lbs and we took this car seat in for the 90 minute car seat test. She passed first try. The lower limit of this car seat is 4lbs which she thankfully met. We drove her back in a 45 minute drive a few days later and she didn’t fuss during the trip.2. The nurse at the hospital was not familiar with this car seat initially and asked us for the base. There is no separate base. The whole car seat is literally it. Eventually she found another nurse that knew how to configure this seat and so we didn’t have issues using this car seat to take our baby home.3. It is really easy to install (Toyota Corolla). My husband said it took a couple minutes just to install it in place before we took our baby home. We installed it in the middle of our back seat.4. Please leave the shoulder inserts on. The nurse initially took it off because she said it’s too thick but the belt was scratching my daughter’s neck on our drive home so I had to use my fingers to open a gap where her neck was. She was so much more comfortable the next day when we put the inserts back on to take her to her pediatrician.

From your first ride together coming home from the hospital to soccer day car pools, the 3-in-1 grow and go car seat will give your child a safer and more comfortable ride. Featuring extended use at each stage, this convertible car seat is designed to last through all your firsts with your child. For newborns to growing toddlers, the grow and go can be used in the rear-facing position from 5-40 pounds. It includes 2 comfortable grow-with-baby pillows to give your new travel companion a snug fit, and they easily remove as your baby outgrows them. In forward-facing mode, the grow and go keeps your child protected in a harness up to 65 pounds. In both rear-facing and forward-facing mode, harness holders keep the harness in an open position. This makes it easier for you to get your child in and out of the car seat. No more fishing for the harness and clips from behind your child - they're right there when you need them. The quick fit Harness offers additional convenience in both of these stages by letting you adjust the height of both the headrest and harness in 1 easy step, making it simple to give your growing child the best fit. When your child is ready to use the vehicle seat belts, remove the harness to use the grow and go 3-in-1 car Seat in belt-positioning booster mode: Up to 100 pounds. The headrest still adjusts easily, letting you get the best fit for your child. As your tiny baby grows into a big kid, messes are bound to happen, but the grow and go car seat pad makes cleanup easy. Machine washable and dryer safe, it is also designed to come off the seat easily, with no need to remove the harness. The grow and go is designed to provide more comfort to parents too. It takes up less room when placed rear-facing, giving up to 7 inches more leg room for parents in the front seat.

I have had this car seat for almost a year. I started using it when my baby was getting too heavy to carry in the infant seat and I wanted something that would stay in my car all the time. First of all, I love the Minnie Mouse design. I’m not sure why others had a hard time installing it because it was the exact same way that I’ve installed every car seat I’ve ever owned. (I have 3 kids and we’ve gone through at least 6 or 7 car seats here). The anchor clips are exactly the same as any other brand I’ve seen (I’ve used graco, britax, chicco, and evenflo, as well as other safety first styles). You can also use the seatbelt install if your car has locking seatbelts. Just make sure you don’t use both methods at the same time as it can put too much stress on the seat and cause it to not function properly over time. The straps are the standard 5 point harness style that is used in America and Canada. I saw some reviews saying the straps are wrong and “unsafe” but I think they were wanting the outdated 3 point harness style with no chest clip like they still use in Australia, the UK, and I believe Asia. Overall, this seat is very easy to install. The padding and material are very soft and comfortable for my baby. I like the ability to raise the back up as she gets taller. I plan to rear face for an extended period of time since my daughter is smaller than average and I’m glad I found this seat that I can use throughout that whole time and also when she’s older and I can forward face her.'}, {'header': 'Comfortable', 'body': 'Absolutely love this car seat for the price and the comfort!.

The access for this is 2 buttons on the bottom of the seat that you press together to lift up the seat to thread the belt. It does have latch but since Britax recommends belt install I have never used or attempted with latch. Thread the belt, buckle, remove any slack and then press the seat back down until it clicks. For a tight install, I find I have to remove enough slack from the belt that I have to kind of kneel on the seat to have it click back into place. In doing this, the seat doesn’t budge at all.As far as comfort goes, my son never seems to be uncomfortable and there appears to be plenty of padding. My 13 lb 3-month old uses the infant insert and the padding is quite thick. The cup holders are excellent. I’ve yet to find a standard 12-oz kids water bottle that doesn’t fit. They easily remove for washing. I recently took all the seat fabric off to wash. It washed and dried wonderfully following the instructions and I didn’t even need a YouTube video to replace the fabric which was a first.This is not a slim fit or lightweight seat. If you frequently need to switch it to a different car, it probably is not the seat for you. While it removes and reinstalls easily, it is quite heavy and cumbersome to move around. I could fit 3 of these across in my expedition with a bench seat, but in a smaller vehicle like my outback, 2 could definitely fit in the outboard seats but an adult would definitely struggle to fit in between. The seat however feels like a tank and this was a big factor in purchasing a second for my infant.The seat adjusts very easily as my son has grown. The straps easily adjust by moving up the headrest. The tension on the straps easily adjusts by pulling the strap at the leg portion of the seat and releasing by pressing a button below the click tight and pulling the straps. I should add that my son is very tall for his age and has plenty of legroom while rear facing.I don’t have any review of the forward facing functions and adjustments for this seat but have no doubt it will be just as easy to adjust as rear facing.'}, {'header': 'Only Car Seat I Will Ever Buy', 'body': 'I purchased this car seat for my 10-month-old grandson because he out-grew his carrier but still needed to be rear-facing.

I watched a very short video on how to install it for rear-facing and then tried it myself. It seriously took me about two minutes start-to-finish! I was so impressed with the car seat that I immediately got online and purchased a second one for my 3-year-old grandson.

I throw the soft material in the wash on a gentle cycle and spray out the rest with a hose.

I was in the market for a convertible car seat for my daughter who was just transitioning out of her infant carrier. My criteria for a car seat was something durable, reliable, safe, convertible, and easy to install. This Britax One4Life car seat is all of those things and more! I purchased the charcoal gray color - as opposed to all black - and absolutely love it. It's still dark enough to hide any dirt/messes pretty well, and works for either a boy or girl. My favorite feature is that it is soooo easy to install in the car. The seat bottom flips up and you simply extend the car seatbelt over the hard base of the car seat and click it into place. Push the seat bottom back down and you're done! I also love that this car seat will grow with my child. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a car seat for their young one!""}, {'header': 'Update #2 BEST SEAT EVER! UPDATE! We love this seat! Original; Random screw in reclining mechanism', 'body': 'UPDATE #2This seat is amazing!Our little fella is now 16 months and 28+ pounds. He rides well in this seat with no complaints of being uncomfortable. He isn’t sweaty when we take him out of the seat.He did get sick one day while I was driving with him alone (super scary!).The seat was easy to clean and looks AND SMELLS amazing even after a huge mess!I really like the fact that it is easy to install. When he is super tired I am able to adjust in the recline (while staying within the guidelines) to something a little more comfortable for snoozing.Love this seat! Worth every penny!Just wish it came with the anti rebound bar...Seems crazy to spend another $55 - especially during a pandemic when we don’t travel often or far.Bottom line - BUY THIS SEAT!UPDATEWe have had the replacement seat for a little over three months.Return of the original seat was super easy via Kohl’s. The new seat came on time and in perfect condition.Our chunk lives this seat!He is super comfortable.It is amazingly easy to install via the lower anchors.Our little one was always sweaty in the infant seat but that hasn’t been a problem in this one.He can see out well so he is happy - maybe he doesn’t feel trapped?Getting him in and out of the seat is easy since the straps stay off to the sides well and the center buckle stays forward so I’m not fumbling for it and struggling with a mobile baby at the same time.If we had the extra funds I would purchase a second one for our Subaru!Moving this seat around is rather cumbersome as it is heavy and awkward for me to move (I’m 5’1” and 110 pounds). The thought of carrying it inside the house makes me cringe but it is a stationary seat so that isn’t a problem.It feels sturdy. When I put him in the seat I know he is safe. I love the padding at the head and couldn’t ask for more from a seat!Other than the straps pull uneven if you yank them from one side I haven’t had any trouble with this seat. Easy fix - pull both straps as it is a Y type system. It’s easy to fix by pulling the shorter strap to adjust until even.Overall - we love this seat! TOTALLY worth the investment!**Amazon delivered this seat on time and undamaged from shipment.We ordered this seat for our nearly 22lb 6 month old as (we gave out Chicco KeyFit to our daughter) our son was uncomfortable in his infant seat on rides lasting longer than 15 minutes. He is just too wide to be comfortable in the Chicco KeyFit.**We loved the KeyFit and would have kept him in it until he reached the maximum height and weight if he wasn’t a short stocky little chunk!I was so excited for this seat to arrive and have a comfortable seat for a little guy. Thank goodness I noticed this screw before installing this seat in my car!! I have no idea if a screw is missing from the inside components of the seat or if an extra one somehow managed to get trapped during manufacturing...I have Amazon sending a replacement that will arrive Monday (this seat came Saturday evening - it now 8am Sunday morning). I am now trapped at home until the new seat arrives. Amazon said they couldn’t get a replacement to me today.I will update once we get the replacement. After all of this I hope the seat lives up to the hype.'}, {'header': 'Spend the extra money', 'body': ""We got this car seat over the graco 4 in 1 and I am happy we did.

So far she hasn't cried once since we purchased this so I'm now assuming she just wasn't comfortable in the other car seat.

Last weekend, we were in a bad car accident where we were rear ended by someone at a high speed (most definitely not our fault). My husband and I both had injuries, the car’s frame was bent, entire back end smashed, and driver’s seat twisted on its frame. Our child came out of the accident without a bruise or scratch, completely unfazed. Without a doubt, this car seat did its job and helped protect him from harm. It could have been so much worse. The emergency personnel inspected the car seat afterwards and nothing was compromised; they were impressed. We’ve already ordered the replacement; thank you Britax.'}, {'header': 'This is it!!! No matter how big or small your car it, the only car seat you will need!', 'body': 'This car seat is everything I have been looking for and it came out just in time!I wanted an extended rear facing car seat up to 50 pounds, as I’ve read that rear facing as long as possible is best for little ones’ spines (in Sweden I think their kids rear face until 4!).I also wanted the seat to be convertible to a front facing and booster seat as well so i wouldn’t have to create lots of waste with multiple car seats over the years.And of course I wanted it to be safe.I did tons of research on the web and consumer reports and narrowed it down to the Chicco nextfit max (though this doesn’t have the booster option), this car seat, and the graco extend2fit.The graco extend2fit would have been my choice if this car seat had not come out. But this car seat wins for several reasons over the graco.The ease of install is incredible. I don’t have to worry about messing with the latch, and I only have to close the click tight panel under the seat once I put the seatbelt across.This is also so padded and comfortable, my mom sat in it and was impressed how nice it was!The final factor was how well it fits in my 2013 Prius C. I was worried when researching that I’d have a hard time finding a seat that fit, especially an extended rear facing seat. This fits the bill perfectly as there is still room in the front seat for a passenger (though not a particularly long legged one, but still, I was expecting not to have room for a front seat passenger!).TL;DR stop searching and get this car seat today if it is in your budget!!! Although this is on the pricier side, the safety of my child is totally worth it to me. When I consider that the seat will last 10 years, and that I spend more on eating out some months than I did on this car seat, it puts things in perspective and is well worth the investment.Please give this review a thumbs up if it was helpful :)'}, {'header': 'Highest safety rating (2020), Great quality, Britax needs to fix lack of replacement fabric', 'body': ""I am very picky on quality. Amazon honestly has a 'mixed bag' of great, good, average and just downright bad products from third-party sellers. I only leave written reviews for truly great items, as I don't have time to write for everything I purchase.I purchased this car seat because it had the highest safety rating on the market (2020). I was very happy with the quality of construction and craftsmanship when the unit was delivered. A year later, I still feel the same way.Will it last for 10 years of use as a convertible car seat, as claimed? The physical unit probably will. It is that well built. The fabric is also very high quality, however I can't imagine 10 years of spills, pukes, messes and general wear leaving the fabric in great condition. That is to be expected, and would apply to any convertible car seat.The fabric on the seat is removeable. The manual says to look at the tag on the fabric to see if it is machine washable. I cannot find the tag, but believe that it is most likely washable. Unfortunately, I tried to purchase a second set of fabric covers. I search both Amazon and Britax's website, and they appear NOT to be offered for this unit. That was the only significant disappointment we had, and something Britax could / should fix. Ultimately however, my decision came down to the safety rating, knowing if the 'fabric didn't make it 10 years,' I would have to purchase a new one.Installing the first time was very confusing, but this was our first child, so I attribute this 'problem' to my lack of experience and not Britax. It took me a solid 30 to 40 minutes. We purchased a second Britax (same model) for our other car. When installing that one, I found it took no more than 15 minutes. If I had to do it again, it would probably take 10 minutes.""}, {'header': 'IN LOVE!!', 'body': 'LOVE LOVE LOVE this seat!!!! So easy to use and very safe!! I’m a critical care paramedic, and I’ve seen quite a few bad accidents in my years. Britax is SO sturdy and I’ve seen many kids with no injuries when sitting in their properly buckled & secured car seats. This seat makes it SO EASY to properly install! I would purchase again and definitely recommend this seat! (Currently using this seat for a 48lb 8yr old, 46inches in forward facing harness mode. She has a TON of room to grow and says this is the most comfortable seat she’s ever sat in! She loves it!)'}, {'header': 'BEST CAR SEAT - STOP SEARCHING AND BUY THIS ONE', 'body': 'FINALLY FOUND A CARSEAT THAT WORKS! This was the 3rd car seat we tried (we tried safety first, maxi cosi, and Graco before this one). We had issues getting the other car seats tight enough in both of our cars - they always moved more than 2 inches. But not his one!!!The “click tight” feature when installing made the process super quick (less than 2 minutes), and made the car seat extremely tight and non moveable. When pushing and pulling on it from side to side, the car seat does not budge at all. I feel extremely safe having my daughter in this car seat. Such a plus that it was easy to install, no more cutting up my hand as I try and fit my wrist in the small belt path to feed the belt through.I also love that it has so many different positions/recline options rather than competing brands only having 3 positions.After having this car seat for 2 months, it still remains very tight and non movable in my car. My daughter seems very comfortable in it. The Graco was not comfortable at all. Britax and maxi cosi were very comparable and felt about the same thickness in padding. This Britax seat is very well made and heavy duty. When comparing with the maxi cosi, the Britax is definitely much heavier, but that is because it is much more solid/durable in its frame - which to me means more safety.The only issue I have had was that the straps became uneven after a months use, which could very likely be from something I did when getting her in and out. I was able to take the car seat out, and pull the straps in and out a few times and fixed the issue. I would give this seat a 10/10 and would purchase again. We spent MONTHS finding the right seat, I wish we would have found this first and saved ourselves a lot of trouble. Spend the extra money and get this one!'}, {'header': 'Well-thought our features and excellent quality', 'body': 'I really love Britax Clicktight seats. We’ve owned a few of them, and they are excellent quality and have superb safety features. They are also made right here in the good ol US of A. The new SafeWash fabrics are naturally flame retardant free (so no added chemicals) and are super fluffy for max comfort. The seat has mesh on the sides for extra ventilation to keep kids cool, which is appreciated in Houston. 🥵 The cover can also be tossed in the washer AND dried in the drier! Another feature I liked was that the seat portion of the cover and the head/back portion are separate so you don’t have to wash the whole thing if only one portion is dirty. The cup holders are also removable and dishwasher safe (winner!). Finally, the seat has an optional anti-rebound bar, which installs at the foot of the car seat and braces it against the seat so it doesn’t go wiggling about in a crash (so it decreases the risk of head/neck trauma). This was a HUGE benefit for me! As a bonus, the anti-rebound bar is covered in fabric so it will keep little shoes off the back of your seat.The seat itself has a pretty small footprint when installed on the most upright setting. There are built in levels on both sides of the seat to show you if the install angle is correct. The manual is easy to read and beautifully color coded to the seat - which I appreciate. The install is really easy, and is meant to be done with the seatbelt so you don’t have to remember to switch from the latch connectors when your baby gets to a certain weight (30 lbs for this seat, by the way).One final thing to mention is that Britax allows the use of their brand accessories with their seats. This is sort of handy because it allows you to put a seat protector mat under the car seat, add a seat back protector so little feet don’t get your vehicle seat dirty, or add a waterproof piddle mat to the bottom of the car seat to protect it from independent semi-potty-trained toddlers and their accidents.'}, {'header': 'Seat has survived two major accidents (replaced after each)', 'body': 'My poor son has been in two fairly major car accidents in the last two years, both times he was fortunately completely protected by this car seat. The first accident he was in the back drivers side, I was driving a crossover SUV and was rear ended at a stop light by a Full sized truck and flown into the sedan in front of me, so double impact. My son was 11 months at the time and didn’t have a single bruise or even red mark from the chest strap, while I sustained permanent injuries.The second accident happened in a similar way when my son was 22 months. My husband was driving his truck, our son in the middle back. He was stopped at a light when a drunk driver hit him at an estimated 60+ mph. All three vehicles involved were completely totaled. My sons car seat, as shown in the picture, did not move an inch. He sustained zero injuries and wasn’t even sore the next day.I’ve always loved this seat because adjusting the straps and taking him out of the seat is so easy. It looks great, easy to clean, and not super bulky. But most importantly I am 100% confident in this seat after protecting my son not only once, but twice. I will never buy another brand! (Of course I did have to buy a replacement after each accident). Thank you britax for savings my sons life!'}, {'header': 'Excellent seat', 'body': ""I love this car seat, I already have one and knew I wanted the same when my daughter was born. My only complaint is that my new model doesn't come with britax's usually snap in buckle to install it to the seat, it's not the cheap metal standard one every brand uses. That was one of my favorite features bc of the ease for install and remove.

LOVE MY DOONA', 'body': 'I have significant arthritis in my feet which would make carrying an infant car seat really difficult because of the extra weight. I absolutely love the Doona. It is easy to fold and even easier to unfold. It pops out of the base easily and isn’t overly heavy. The actual car seat structure is fantastic and feels really secure. There is no storage- but there is great options to add on (the knock offs work GREAT!)I’m 5’8 and the height isn’t an issue for me. My husband is over 6 foot and doesn’t mind it. The handle does have to be in a specific position in order to get it to fold so the first few times were difficult but after you have folded and unfolded a handful of times, it feels really easy, even when you have a baby in it. because of the bulk of the wheels when it’s folded, it can be a little bit cumbersome to get it in the car or out of the car but it’s a small price to pay for the convenience and portability overall. The only other negative would be that if the wheels get dirty of the stroller than it will obviously get your car dirty. You can buy protectors. This isn’t a big deal for us but I could see how it might be a problem for others.One thing I would consider, if you are having a C-section consider the wait restrictions during recovery. You may need assistance getting it in and out of the car in the mediate postpartum period during dr visits, etc. I just took my kiddo out instead of unfolding the entire stroller.The stroller maneuvers really well and does great in tight spaces. It’s worth every penny.'}, {'header': 'If you’re on the edge: it’s worth it!', 'body': 'My wife and I already purchased a system for our first daughter due to us in May. We had heard so much good stuff about the doona from friends but didn’t know if we were the people to spend more than necessary on something like this for convenience… however, within a week of receiving this stroller we were overwhelmed with joy that we bought it! It makes doing life with our daughter just so much easier and more enjoyable. It even safely straps into a vehicle using a seatbelt so we can travel a cross the country without checking a bully car seat base! We have told everybody who asked, “this is so worth the investment” and we look forward to using it with all our future children as well because it’s durable and sturdy and we anticipate it to last! So if you’re thinking “do I really need this?” The answer is a definite yes!!! Our daughter is 3 months old now and we use this every single day.(Also it has an infant insert that held her so perfectly as a newborn and she sleeps in it soooooo well!)'}, {'header': 'Best purchase ever. Period.', 'body': 'Let me clearly state that this has been the best and most satisfying purchase I’ve ever made in Amazon (and probably everywhere else). It arrived just the day the baby was born, and so we were able to come out of the hospital with the baby in it the next day. It was amazing having learned how to use it right away. We had a 15 minute walk from the hospital to our home and we chose to go that way instead of using a car. Since then we have been using the Doona every day and our baby has always felt comfy and happy when we seat him in it. It’s very maneuverable and it has served its purpose for every use we have thought of for it. So here’s a short summary of use cases we’ve successfully checked:- Taking the baby to the restaurant for lunch and dinner: we have used it in car seat mode and kept him just by our side in long benches in restaurants or as a stroller (with the brakes on) and replacing a seat at the table with it. It’s compact enough to avoid people getting in close proximity to its wheels, unlike most strollers.- Taking the baby on a ferry: Yes! It worked wonderfully in car seat mode for this. And the baby really likes traveling since his first day out (really thanks to the Doona... remember the baby adapts to your lifestyle instead of otherwise, if you choose to do so).- Using Uber: We’ve taken the baby on more than 50 rides and all drivers -really, all of them- were impressed at how easy it was for us to get him in and out of the car, converting from stroller to car seat and back to stroller in an easy operation. Just tell your Uber they don’t need to get off the car to open the trunk or help handling the stroller, because it’s instantly a car seat. It has made our life out of home really easy.- Taking the baby to the beach: just convert to car seat and carry it with the handle and then pop out the wheels when you hit your palm tree spot. The integrated shade helps keep the baby comfortable but we go extra cautious and always put a blanket covering the top of the Doona so no mosquitoes or too much sun and wind gets in. There’s an official sunshade but we found it easy to go the cheap way since we didn’t get the sunshade along and didn’t want to wait for shipping times.- Taking the baby to the movies: Yes! Believe it or not, babies like Avengers even if it’s a three hour long movie. We just put the Doona in car seat mode and voilà! Just check the baby for signs of wet diaper and maybe go to change it once through the movie to avoid crying. Remember to seat close to the aisles or next to the handicapped seats and you’ll enjoy your movie date once again and not having to wait for years to go back to the cinema. Actually having done this helped us emotionally since we found out we still can do things we like.- Taking the baby on a plane: Oh, yes... we had an international flight at week 5 and we felt like a “moving Kodak picture spot/opportunity” everywhere through the airport. It was so easy to get to narrow or crowded places and there are two ways of traveling with it: 1. Taking it to the gate and unloading the baby right at the plane’s door and the airline will take care of it and put it with the cargo and then deliver it back when you get out of the door so you can keep using it through customs and luggage pick up without having to hold the baby the whole time. And... 2. Getting a seat for your baby that you can take the Doona on board because it’s certified for air travel... We chose option 1 and saved some money for diapers and baby formula. And it was by far the easiest to use stroller/seat we saw (and the airline staff said that too). There were other babies on both planes we took and honestly they weren’t having as good time as we were.- Taking the car seat through TSA check... easy... it goes through the X-ray machine in car seat mode, flipped upside down. Just the right size for that.- Taking the baby to doctor’s appointments: waiting rooms sometimes get crowded and we were happy our Doona didn’t take as much space, avoiding making other people uncomfortable. During an appointment I found out another “mode” for the Doona that I’ve never seen in reviews or elsewhere: just retract the wheels to put it in car seat mode and leave it in the floor. Surprisingly, it works like a rocking chair! Really, just try it when you get yours and be amazed at that “rocking chair” mode. I’ve never seen so many “WTF” faces around before.- Getting in and out of elevators with one hand: just retract the handle and put it upright and it will take the less space possible. It’s so easy to do.- Going shopping: it’s so small and flexible you can take it to the outlets and feel like a “Kodak picture spot/opportunity” once again (actually someone mentioned that while I retracted the Doona to climb some stairs and avoiding a long ramp other parents where going through slowly (hence the photo op... a line of parents wasting time and only one avoiding the traffic jam).Now we’re in month 5 and while most of this review was written during the first two months, nothing has changed and we’re happy we went the Doona way. We removed the newborn insert just before month 3 and baby didn’t even notice the change.Short summary: we have been happy parents thank to Doona.***********Follow up: Our baby is 2.5 years old now and we miss the Doona. We used it for 15 months and once again, we miss it but it surely made another happy family after us. If there could be something similar for toddlers, we would definitely buy it. But honestly, still think it was the best purchase ever.'}, {'header': 'Love love love!!!!♡', 'body': 'I will be uploading these photos and videos later but the overall quality of the doona is worth every penny knowing the safety and quality of this car seat. If you have hip and back problems I would recommend getting this for your baby. It has become a life saver to not only me but my best friend has one as well as my best friends brother. And many times over it never fails how great this car seat is! Not only that, but it delivers FAST too. All around I love this car seat and my next baby will also have this exact one (maybe a different color depending on the gender) due to the safety, quality, and durability this car seat will NOT let you down. Thank you!!!!♡'}, {'header': 'Cut out all the extra load-up/unload time out', 'body': 'Listen…. To all the buyers, soon to be parents, multiple kids parents with new plus ones in the family. LET ME TELL YOU how skeptical 🤨 I was on purchasing something such as a car seat for or close to $500. I did the typical well we can save money and get a stroller and a car seat separately and the baby will still be safe. I know you are prob doing the same. BUT listen… HEAR ME OUT…. The amount of time it takes to put the baby into a car seat get the baby into the car. Oh you need to stop by the grocery store? Are you just going to carry the car seat or are you going to get into the trunk for the stroller and swap the baby to the stroller. Ughhh so much time wasted. Not to mention sometimes places like restaurants don’t allow strollers. Now it’s an inconvenience… CUT all of this out. For the love of GOD I wish I had this doona for my first born. It makes thing so much easier being able to pop the wheels out and just take off and on about my day. The doona is a bit heavier than most car seats but you can adjust and get used to it fairly quickly. The fact that if I don’t want to have a stroller and I just want to carry my baby is absolutely amazing. ESP if for example I can’t take a stroller onto say an escalator but I can a car seat. Or like I said earlier about the restaurants… easy peasy boom my stroller is now a car seat.I know the price seems steep. But listen the resale value of these are high because they’ve to my knowledge never had a recall and the engineering behind them are amazing and safe. I now own two of them (one for each car). Yeah I spent a grand on them but that’s an investment like no other. And serious peace of mind and less hard ache.

It also makes everyday errands easy and travel a breeze (I have flown twice with zero issues gate checking it).

I believe this carseat (Evenflo EveryFit 4-in-1 Convertible Car Seat, Olympus) could be the only car seat you need as it will accommodate a newborn, but we liked being able to buckle the baby into the seat in the house and carry them out, so I cannot review the newborn stage of this carseat; I can, however, tell you that my toddler loves it. I love how easy it is to buckle him in. We loosen the straps every time we unbuckle and tighten the straps each time we get back in the van (Dodge Grand Caravan-middle row captain chair-latch system) because it's so simple with the easy release.We bought this car seat at $189.99 up front and because it adapts to the different stages of safety we need as our kids grow over ten years this carseat will cost breakdown to $19 a year. That seems like a deal to me. For reference we still have our oldest daughter rear-facing at 38 lbs and she'll be four in 5 months (Evenflo SafeMax Platinum All-in-One Convertible Car Seat, Madalynn). We've loved our Evenflo products.Update: Two and a half years in and I just had to order a replacement chest clip (his cracked) and when I went to throw the liner in the wash I notice the foam head piece was broken into three pieces (it says do not remove) so now I have to figure out how to fix that part.""}, {'header': 'Great Value', 'body': 'The chest clip and buckle are MUCH nicer than previous versions I’ve used! The buckle makes a clear click that is easy to connect and disconnect. The release button also doesn’t jam up like others and releases with less effort. The harness covers are a little smaller and less substantial than other models, and the buckle cover tends to just get in the way when buckling my toddler in, but it’s nice that it comes with them because not all do and it’s easy to discard if it gets in the way. The seat cover fabric and piping look nice and well-made. The meshy/jersey-like material gives the seat a sporty look which I imagine would help keep your baby cool, but its also prone to harboring cracker crumbs, which you’re going to have a lot of...especially since this seat comes with an awesome cupholder/snack tray combo!The latch connectors are nice. Definitely better than standard metal hooks but far inferior to the ratchet-style that comes on the Evenflo EveryStage. It would be nice to see a version with those but for under $200, and for a feature that is only used for the first two years or so, these latch connectors are a step up.This seat has several bonus features like buckle pockets and a color-coding system to help you get installation right. The instruction manual, side labeling, latch release straps, and plastic components like the rear tether are highlighted in color which you will REALLY appreciate, especially if you are new to car seats.In short, there’s a TON of value here.

I was impressed with the degree of padding on this seat, how nice it looks, and my child was super excited to sit in it. Has the look and feel of a commander's chair. Cup holders are big and one has an extra appendage that holds snacks as well as the cup, which is nice. Only drawback for others might be the size; in a smaller vehicle with multiple car seats, I could see space being an issue.

We have used Chicco since they were born and we will always be loyal! My son\'s both had the chicco infant car seats, the convertible car seats, and this is their 3rd. I tried using a Graco from a family member while waiting for a new Chicco to arrive and it was so hard that I felt bad putting my child in it. Trying to wash Graco\'s ""padding"" took me hours because I had to unloop around 50 to release it. I will break my review down into sections to make it easier to read.Comfort- Chicco has always been the top dog with car seat comfort in my opinion. They have soft padding with the option of adding more too. The padding is not only extremely well made keeping Chicco\'s high quality, but it is comfortable and logical too. My boys love their Chicco\'s more than I do because it ""doesn\'t feel hard on their butt"". My parent\'s have 2 Graco seats in their car for when they stay the night. My parents keep telling me that they\'re about to switch to Chicco\'s because they feel bad about the complaints from the boys of ""it hurts my butt, its so hard. I want my comfy one thats in mommys car"". The little Console helps with comfort too, so they have a place for small toys or even a quick snack. The padding for this seat is at least 5x thicker/better than other car seats. Every single booster I felt in the stores felt rock hard and I want my boys to be comfortable as we are on the go a lot. I am so glad that Chicco did not skimp on the padding just because it\'s a booster like every other company has done.Features I love- This car seat has so many convenient features that you cannot find with others. 2 cup holders and even a little storage compartment for toys or quick snacks. The storage compartment has a round part that slips into one of the cup holders and works on both sides, not just one. It is made of quality plastic that cannot be easily broken by destructive toddlers. We have dropped them on our concrete driveway many times with zero damage. Another feature that I love that has been on all of Chicco\'s car seats that we have had is the zipper to remove padding. Kids are extremely messy, but Chicco makes it easy so you can stop worrying about car seat stains! Just unzip the padding and toss it in the wash! No clips, stretchy loops, or padding that can\'t be washed. The latch system by Chicco is by far the best out there. No fussing with metal latches that are impossible to unhook or jam in between the seats. Chicco has a simple easily accessible release button and that\'s all you need to do! This car sear can also be reclined to different settings but is obviously limited because it\'s a booster so it doesn\'t have a base. I don\'t use the recline feature because my son likes to sit straight up. The seat belt holder near the headrest keeps the belt from bothering your child. It keeps it out of the way and prevents scratches or red marks from the seat belt digging into their neck. Last but not least, the adjustable feature. Chicco has always made adjusting seats so easy and effortless and I love that. This seat has a button on the back that you push and then pull up the seat to the height that is required for your child. I am even able to do this in the car while my child is buckled in if I notice it is too short/high. Never put the headrest too high, that creates an unsafe ride for your child as he/she will not have the safety of the surrounding head support area.Things I don\'t like- I wish the directions stated what the 2 extra pieces were. I spent over 2 hours trying to figure it out myself after I put these 2 seats together, and google didn\'t help either! If you are wondering what they are I believe they are extra arm rest covers. I wish the little storage console was more securely in the cup holder when in use, like clicking in so it can\'t just tumble out. The storage console attachment just sits inside of the cupholder and both of my boys have issues with them just falling out on their own, causing some spilled snacks very frequently. When I am moving the 2 seats to our other vehicles these attachments literally fall out before the seat is even out of the 1st car. These sit so loosely in the cup holder with no stability and It would be nice to see an improvement in the future where the attachment clicks into the cupholder and has a button like your awesome latch release system when you want to remove them. Those are the only issues I have with this but it doesn\'t make me love Chicco any less!All in all, as someone who has used Chicco and only Chicco for my childrens car seats for over 6 years now, I highly highly recommend this booster seat. You will not find a single seat like it. You may see other seats online with pictures showing very nice padding but once it comes in the mail its like sitting directly on the plastic.'}, {'header': 'Great investment for grandparents', 'body': ""I bought this seat for my 6 yr. old grandson once his parents decided he was ready to use a booster seat. I got it unboxed and put together in about 45 minutes, using the enclosed instructions (DON'T start with the instructions for removing the zip-off lining like I did!) and after viewing a YouTube video. Frankly, the video was not that helpful because it skipped around a bit, but since it is for my grandson's safety, I wanted to make sure I did it correctly. Installing it into my Jeep Liberty was a breeze - don't be intimidated. Getting to ride in grandma's car was a big deal for both of us and now I enjoy being able to pick him up after school, etc. Grandson says it is comfy but it took him a while to master fastening the seat belt by himself. No big deal, he's got it now. We have not yet removed the seat back but will probably do that in the next month. I also purchased the Stander CarCaddie from Amazon, which I attached to the metal bars under the front seat headrest to help him get into and out of the backseat of my car.Stander CarCaddie""}, {'header': 'Best!', 'body': 'After extensive research I decided on this option and I am glad I did.

It is very frustrating especially when you're in a hurry and while this does happen at some point with pretty much all car seats and even seatbelts, it's probably happened no less than 15 times with this seat since we installed it. It's majorly annoying.Other than that, this seat takes the cake in safety, features, comfort, and ease of installation. My husband managed to get this installed in his truck on his own, which is impressive as we normally have to bring them to the fire station just to get them figured out and put into the car. The seat is massive and very plush for your child. It also sits up just a little higher than her other seats and this enables her to peek out of the window! I think she'd tell you that's the best part about it.We have not used the sidewall adapters because our seats are installed in the center of our cars, but they are a really nice safety feature that I think would give me a lot of peace of mind if I did need to use it.Overall I'm very pleased with this seat and would not only suggest it to others, but would return to purchase another one for myself if I needed one in the future. The only downside to these seats really is that it is bulky and will take up a lot of your back seat, but that doesn't really bother me much at all. I love this seat and would consider it very highly recommended!""}, {'header': 'Great car seat', 'body': ""We had been using Maxi-Cosi car seats for years, and this is our first time trying Cybex. It's a great car sear overall. The quality of material is great and nothing to complain of. My daughter said it's comfortable to sit in and easy to fall in sleep. We once drove a 4 hour trip with her sitting in the car seat, and she was okay with it. No complaint and discomfort during long drive. This car seat is easy to install correctly after reading the given instructions.""}, {'header': '4 pounds to 120 pounds this might be the only carseat you buy!', 'body': ""I replaced my Maxi-Cosi Magellan Max All-in-One with this Cybex Eternis S All-in-One and honestly I am happy to have made the change. I personally find the comfort, installation, fabric, price and 3 position reclining headrest to be superior to the Maxi-Cosi. Either method you should use the tether.The installation was pretty easy - although the instruction manual could be set up better in regards to using the cars LAP/SHOULDER BELT vs the lower anchor and their breakdown for weight limitations. You can use the lower anchor system to install until your child is 40 pounds and then you need to use the lap belt.Rear-facing from 4 lbs. to 50 lbs.Forward Facing from 22 lbs. to 65 lbs. (up to 40 pounds you can use the Lower Anchor system otherwise you need to use the cars LAP/SHOULDER BELT) Either Method you need to use the Tether.Belt-positioning Booster from 40 lbs. to 120 lbs.A tip when installing with a seat that reclines slightly - my Subaru outback features slightly reclining seats - this really helps to tighten the LAP/SHOULDER BELT. Lay the seat back as far as it will go and get the lap/shoulder belt though the back of the carseat as instructions show and ensure the Lock-Off is engaged - from there just tighten it as much as you can by pulling the lap/shoulder belt to remove slack and then bring the seat up to the correct position - this should help you get a tight installation!-MeasurementsWidth at widest point: 19 inches2 crotch buckle positions: 4 and 5.5 inches from the back of the seat panSeat pan depth: 13 inchesLowest harness height: 8 inches without padding, 7 inches with paddingHighest harness height: 17 inchesHighest shoulder belt guide position: 18 inches-Recline PositionsRear facing: Recline positions 1,2, 3, or 4Forward facing: Recline positions 5 or 6Booster mode: Recline position 6 only-Unique FeaturesL.S.P. - The Linear Side Impact Protection extends from the side of the seat that’s closest to the vehicle door.I found adjusting the Headrest was super easy once I figured out how to move the toggle on the back of the seat, along with that the headrest is adjustable! This is a wonderful feature to help ensure your child is comfortable.Headrest Adjustment - You will find this lever mounded below the headrest behind where your child's neck would be if they were sitting in the seat. Ensure it locks into place after adjusting.Reclining Headrest - The headrest on this carseat is adjusted independently of the height adjustment and this handle is right at the top - while my first instinct was that this would adjust the height I was wrong. Depending on yourGuidelines for the headrest recline positions:Height adjustable positions 1-3: no recline availableHeight adjustable positions 4: recline 1 and 2 availableHeight adjustable positions 5-12: recline 1,2, and 3 availableThe top Tether is one of the most important safety features of a forward facing car seat - but if you are using this from birth, you won't need that right away and it is tucked into the back in a pocket that you just pop open from the top. This is also where the manual is stored - when you have your carseat installed forward facing that does make getting to it a bit difficult - but the digital manual is easy to find on the Cybex website.Booster Seat - Easy enough to convert - but please read the manual as there are a few steps that you do not want to miss, such as how to fold the crotch buckle forward into the compartment on the seat pan as it stays attached to the carseat base. From there the Top Shoulder Belt Guide is easy to use and at a nice height. This booster is large enough at the base that it might be difficult for your child to buckle themselves in without engaging the locking mode.FAA Approval — the Eternis S is approved for use on aircraft when it’s in harnessed mode. The FAA Approval label is located on the bottom of the seat. Since the Eternis S weighs in at 25 pounds, we’d be pretty surprised if too many families end up using it for travel.Date of manufacture label — the Eternis S expires 10 years after the date of manufacture. Both the manufacture date and the expiration date are on a label on the bottom of the seat.Overall Thoughts - The Eternis S features a plush cover and an excellent fit for both of my children in both harness and booster mode. Both of my children found it to be comfortable.""}, {'header': 'Quality car seat', 'body': 'Installs very easy.

This seat also doesn't have the seat sensor to alert you if the kid unbuckles themselves, if it gets too hot or cold, or to remind you that they're in the car.

It’s well made, sturdy, and has a full 10 years before expiration (received 07/2021, manufactured 03/2021). Installing forward-facing with the LATCH system is simple, due to easy access to the lower strap tighteners. I especially like the clip mechanism for the lower LATCH straps, which grab onto the bar and are released by pulling on a tab — no more feeling around in the seat crack to push on a spring!It has a comprehensive manual (104 pages of English alone). There are many options (infant rear-facing, rear-facing, forward-facing, and booster), so customizing the fit to our child took a bit of time. Sometimes it was hard to find the right instructions hidden among all the safety warnings, but once found, the instructions are clearly written and the diagrams are good.One downside: it’s heavy (26 pounds, vs. 16 pounds for my old Evenflo seat). When the family flies to a place where we’ll use a rental car, I bring a car seat, carrying it in a backpack on a bus and subway and then walking through the airport until I can gate-check the seat (which is free).

Problem is our 3 year old is just barley under the new height limit of 34 inches and my soon to be 8 year old is one inch away from the updated max height of 49 inches. I measured with a measuring tape the height the seats go up to at the highest and the lowest setting and they are exactly the same as my older Pioneer Model. In fact, when I measured my 3 and 7 year old sitting in the car seat, their ears and head are within the recommended location, so I am unclear as to why they made the change, especially since our Pediatrician recommended we keep our 45 pound 8 year old in the 5 point harness as it is so much safer than getting whiplash from relying on the seat belt buckle. see less', 'num_of_votes': 15, 'num_of_answers': 4, 'answered_by': 'Mother'}, {'body': 'What is the difference between the grow with you and the grow with you plus?', 'answer': 'Thank you for asking!

Easiest, quickest install, with the most secure fit.'}, {'header': 'Has a higher height limit than advertised, excellent seat', 'body': 'First of all, the height limits on this seat are incorrectly advertised. Britax has published that this seat has a maximum standing height of 49” for harness mode, however they also state that it has a maximum seated height of 20.5” for harness mode. For clarification on why these two heights don’t match up: the other Britax seats that are known to have a max seated height of 20.5” also have a max standing height of 58”. So obviously if this seat has a max seated height of 20.5” (which it truly does), by default the standing height must be higher. I have contacted Britax about this but they are unwilling to admit the error, which is a shame because most people who are looking for a harness to booster seat with a higher height limit (like we were) are going to pass over this seat based on the incorrectly published standing height limit, and not dig deeper to realize that the seated height limit is actually quite high.So to recap: this seat has a 20.5” seated height limit for harness mode, which is equivalent to a 56”-58” standing height limit, and is therefore an excellent option for people who wish to keep their older (or just taller) kids in a harness for longer.Our 5.5 year old is 46” tall, but has a long torso and has outgrown her excellent Britax Boulevard car seat, which has an 18.5” seated height limit and a 49” standing height limit. I’ve played around with the harness height on this new Grow With You seat, and it still has several more inches to go up in harness mode from where it fits her now, which means we will be able to keep her in a harness for a good while longer before we need to convert to booster mode.This seat seems comfortable from what I can tell (and from what my daughter tells me). It has a nice wide seat and it is roomy in her shoulders (unlike the Chicco MyFit we tried out which had a shockingly narrow seat and not much shoulder room width-wise), and I have no doubt that this seat has enough room for her to grow over the next 5+ years that we will need it.As always the Britax ClickTight feature is a game changer for quick, easy, and correct installation. Something to note however, is that the base of this seat is different from the Boulevard and Marathon seats, meaning the ClickTight feature on this seat is also different. Although we have owned a Britax Boulevard ClickTight seat for the past 5 years, I did not intuitively know how to use the Grow With You ClickTight, and I did need to read the instruction manual. However, once I read the manual it was a piece of cake and I was able to securely install the seat in minutes.Also, I’ve read that there were issues with tightening the harness straps on the Frontier and Pinnacle seats. This Grow With You seat does not have any of those issues; it tightens and loosens easily and securely.And of course, the color choices on this seat are quite nice, and my daughter LOVES her purple seat. My only complaint is that the fabric is not machine washable with this model. That should be a standard feature on EVERY car seat, and I do find that really irritating. But overall this is an excellent seat, as I have come to expect from Britax.I’ve attached a picture comparing our old Boulevard seat (left) at its highest harness setting, with our new Grow With You seat (right) at one of its middle harness settings.'}, {'header': 'What a piece of junk (non clicktight seat)', 'body': ""I have owned Britax car seats for 6 years, spent thousands to put a pair of frontiers in 4 vehicles. Due to Amazon's site poor design, I accidentally ordered this, a non-clicktight seat when i thought i was just choosing a different color, for a replacement since I can no longer get the Frontier (which was a great car seat compared to the new junk they are producing) and this carseat is complete crap. You can't pull hard enough on the seat belt to not have a seat that jiggles all over with barely a nudge. I did all the tethers and the seat belt and am disgusted by how long it took and how flimsy the design is, the bottom panel just completely came off in my hands when I tilted it forward like it asks you to do to get the tethers out and getting the small pieces back in they get caught and bend. The straps for the child's shoulders aren't even the same length so they're completely uneven when you buckle them in with one shoulder pinned tight and he is able to get the other arm out. I am horrified because I have spent years talking about how great my frontiers and marathons have been and this was just so awful I hope no one bought one for their child. I'm going to attempt to return this but since I've opened it no idea if I can or should because I wouldn't want another kid in it.""}, {'header': 'Best choice!', 'body': 'I did so much research and went back and forth on a couple of car seats and this one is so nice.

So today it comes in and first thing I notice is now nice it feels...I was worried about the cushion and I'm not sure what other reviewers were referring to but this seat is not hard...next I checked out the cheap clips holding the pad down that need to be removed to adjust the crotch strap (after reading the reviews and CSFTL review I was very careful).. recline the seat, shine a flashlight under to see what you are doing, push the cover on the top part of seat towards the clip to create extra give to the fabric and turn that clip from the underside to the wider part of the opening so it won't snap.. It's a pain but something you won't be doing often or many times... Installation was kind of difficult because I have a 2008 Chevy avalanche and it's tight in that back seat and the top tether took some time and folding down half of the bench to be able to pull the tail of tether to tighten it but I did it....lastly my son fell asleep in it and even on the recline his head fell to his chest but this happened in his Chicco max nextfit zip ,which is my absolute favorite convertible seat, unless it was on the deepest setting for forward facing... My son says it's comfy comfy comfy and moos when he sees the cow print (which I love the option for something different) and I am so happy I took the chance..""}, {'header': 'Sturdy, safe, and comfortable', 'body': ""This is our 2nd Britax car seat, after sizing-up from the Britax Marathon Clicktight.

My daughter got sick all over it, which was extremely difficult to clean. I could not get the base off to clean under it, I had to spray it out to clean it. So if something spills, it goes right down into the inside and all over, impossible to scrub out. The material is wash-worthy, I managed to wash the seat part just fine and it held up well. I had to soak the nylon straps in hot water, I could not scrub them clean. When I install the seat, it does not move at all. I use the belt to secure it, along with the anchors and tethers, so I feel like my kid is safe in it. It is quite thick and soft to sit in (so my daughter tells me). It sits up a little high, might be why she gets car sick. If you have kids with sensory issues who get car sick, bring a bowl and towels for this one.
