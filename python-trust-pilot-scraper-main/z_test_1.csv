0,The RealReal,Sam J.,The Burberry hoodie I purchased was listed as very nice. It was anything but that. It not only was so dirty the label was literally black around the edges it reeked of cologne and had stains on it. Based on that alone I won’t be purchasing another item from TheRealReal.,55,1,"September 06, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=1
1,The RealReal,First time customer,The product condition description was not accurate. Sadly one of the boot buckles was clearly broken and the item is not returnable. But the first purchase discount offer was very nice.,33,2,"September 03, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=1
2,The RealReal,Rich Knapp,"Ordered a very expensive Hermes chain in a gift box.  It was knotted up.  Absolutely ridiculous, but not the true wording i would use.  I will be returning and never using them again.  SLOPPY",43,1,"September 10, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=1
3,The RealReal,customer,The item was misrepresented. Condition  was NOT as stated! They Did Not report a large gash on top of the Chanel bag nor the “cloudiness”of the patent leather …they wrote the condition as “very good”. They wrote minor scratches on hardware and slight loss of shape due to wear…This was absolutely not truthful!  I tried contacting  TRR without Any success. I will think twice before ever ordering in the future,76,5,"September 07, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=1

5,The RealReal,Shlomit,"Absolutely terrible. I live in the UK, not only was the shipping insanely expensive but I received NO updates.I paid $45 for shipping and at no point was I updated that I needed to pick up from a pick up point (with very inconvenient hours for anyone that works and closed on the weekends). I think it's outrageous to charge so much, not deliver to the address and to not even write it anywhere. I had to go out of my way and track the package and call UPS to discover it needed to be collected. Also there is no convenient way to contact customer service on TRR website.",117,1,"September 11, 2022",GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=2

7,The RealReal,customer,"Would have liked to send my last purchase to a different shipping address.However, from an I phone, things happen so fast, no opportunity to change shipping address.

However the auto reply was that TRR only responds within a certain time… much too late, the shipment had already been sent.",65,4,"August 26, 2022",CA,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=2
8,The RealReal,customer,"Terrible customer service—probably the worst I’ve ever dealt with and have had to now involve my credit card company. Patronizing and lack professionalism, follow through, or concern for client needs. Also items are often different from their descriptions, in worse conditions and or missing buttons, belts, etc without any indication on the listing. I will still shop here for good deals but buyer beware. I believe Poshmark and especially eBay provide a better service with better buyer protection.",82,2,"September 09, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=2

1,The RealReal,P. Myers,"I ordered a pair of Jimmy Choo slingback leather shoes that said “very good “ condition. The shoes arrived and they were far from “very good” the leather was all  torn up , when I unbuckled the shoe strap, before I even tried the shoe on, the strap - the leather strap BROKE ! These shoes were NOT returnable, so instead of throwing them out wasting money I have to have them repaired which will cost twice as much as what I paid on TRR. Im dubious of buying anything from TRR again .",105,2,"August 27, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=3
2,The RealReal,MFC,"I will continue to purchase from TheRealReal because some the items you can find there are hidden gems, but honestly, sometimes items are extremely overpriced for what they are and their condition. However, the main reason I give TRR three (3) stars is the fact that - more than once - items I have received are falsely advertised; they are Men’s shoes instead of Women’s, they are not in Excellent or Pristine condition, sizing is off, features indicated in the description don’t match the item… just to name a few. Also, Customer Service is terrible and they only give you $12 per “error”. TRR has to take more accountability of these terrible mistakes. When I happily open a package just to learn the item is way off what was advertised is saddening.",141,3,"September 11, 2022",DO,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=3

17,The RealReal,Melissa ,I sent my items in to sell and was told I could ask for them back anytime and when I noticed the pricing on my items was completely off I asked for them back.

3,The RealReal,customer,"The ""First Look"" is a scam.  I was supposed to receive e-mails about new items before they are listed on the site.  I have never received any e-mails.  When I called to cancel, the representative told me to send an e-mailwhich I did.  My concerns were never addressed and instead, I was told that I would get advance notice of sales.  This is not what is stated for ""First Look"".  TRR will not credit for partial months.  Also, when I went to cancel the subscription online, it takes me back to the site to sign up.",108,1,"August 31, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=4

14,The RealReal,customer,"My recent experience was quite poor. I purchased an item marked as in ""Excellent Condition,"" which arrived with very obvious underarm stains, and a torn, pinned together lining. I offered to show photos of the damage and stains within an hour of receiving the item, and was denied the opportunity. I was offered a very insignificant credit/refund, or the ability to return the item as resolution options. The customer service rep was not able to tell me how the credit/refund amount was calculated, but it was not even the cost of basic shipping. What a very disappointing experience.",101,2,"September 09, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=4

13,The RealReal,Caterina,"Yesterday my Vince cashmere sweater arrived in a crumpled heap inside its RealReal drawstring bag. When I opened the bag, the sweater was scrunched into a messy ball. The sweater was in a badly disheveled state with deep creases and one sleeve pulled inside out. Did someone try it on and then quickly fling it into the bag? That's what it looked like. I've ordered lots of RR items that arrived nicely folded in their bags, so this problem was not due to the sweater being tossed around during shipping. I'm working on removing the creases from this sweater and hope I can keep it, but I'm very disappointed in the extremely poor level of customer service in this transaction.",124,1,"September 09, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=5
14,The RealReal,Karen Peterson,"I think your concept and for the most part, your employees are terrific.  My frustrations are as follows:1. Better selection of items should be done up front with rep.  I always dry clean my clothes before submitted.  Any rejected come back completely crumpled  and creased.  Aggravating and costly to me as I have to clean again.2. My rep is always changing.  You establish a relationship with someone, then receive an email that there is someone new to deal with.3. Emails are not reliable. I did not receive an email asking to have a piece of jewelry reduced.  The price reduction was taken which I was advised was against policy.  Eileen in jewelry has been helpful in trying to resolve, but has not received a response from the individuals she elevated the problem to.4. Too much is decentralized.  Never can figure out who is the right person to direct questions to. VERY frustrating!5.  Overall, I find responsiveness lacking.  You're great up front, then it all goes to hell.",179,1,"August 29, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=5

17,The RealReal,Fiona Sibley,The dress I ordered is a 2 part dress consisting of a black slip dress and see through over dress.  This is per the description on the manufacturer website and others in various sites selling the dress.  I did not receive the slip dress that is supposed to go underneath. The fact that this was missing was not mentioned in the real real description and I can’t figure out how to contact them.

0,The RealReal,Maria Nee,"I am not satisfied with the delivery of jewelry.  On two different occasions, one package was left in front of my door in plain site and in another occasion it was delivered in error to a neighbor around the corner.

1,The RealReal,MM,"I don't feel that the bag I got was priced/appraised properly. It's clear this bag was left in the sun and the leather was warped. I got it in the mail and have not switched it over to holding my stuff yet because the sides (not pictured in the listing pictures) are peeling so much I'm afraid to even use it. Was listed as ""Very Good"" condition and should've been listed as good or fair.

19,The RealReal,Mj,I would of never believed I would have EVER owned a pair of Manolo Blahnik shoes but The RealReal made that more than possible. I now own 3 pairs of “very good condition” *puts her finger to her chin with with a raised eyebrow* looks like a store model rarely used almost pristine to me! No matter to me I’ll send them off to the cobbler and have them add a nice Manolo Blahnik protective sole cover and get a little cleaning and buffing done while they are at it. The RealReal is my preferred site for purchasing luxury items. Please give it a try if you too want to level up your life and self esteem a bit.

0,The RealReal,Mia,"An absolute disappointment. Worst customer support for a VIP seller. Please think twice before sending your luxury items, as they will not respect pricing requests, and your items will be sent back damaged. Long story short, I sent out a brand new LV wallet purchased on April 2022. I asked my account manager for a price quote before listing the item. Not only was this not followed, but my LV wallet was also listed at $150. The picture on the site showed a yellow circle on the wallet, as if they had placed something heavy on top of it that stained the wallet. I've been trying to resolve this since 8/14/2022 and keep getting the run-around. The SMS messaging support is useless. I've talked to Jessa, Shantel, Kylie, Susy, Alaia, and now Sade. I've asked multiple times for a callback from a manager, which has been denied/ignored. I'm tired of wasting my time over this but is the lack of empathy, sense of urgency, and care for a VIP seller.",175,1,"September 09, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=7

11,The RealReal,Customer,"I was so excited for my first experience with TRR. I used the Obsession Page to track and build outfits, the sizing measurements were used to ensure everything would fit, the website and app were built with great care. Border fee's to ship to Canada were insane. Then, 3 of my 7 items didn't end up fitting. I went to set up a return and a return shipping label was not provided. I contacted customer service and they said I had to pay to ship the items back. I explained, I ordered items knowing that they said they could be returned if necessary (I really wanted everything to work out). The service member said that because it was a size issue they would not be giving me a shipping label. The box would easily cost $50 to ship back. I was sooooo disappointed because I really thought I found a great sustainable clothing option.",156,1,"September 07, 2022",CA,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=7

13,The RealReal,Heather,The item I received is either a fake or not in the condition advertised by TheRealReal. It was not worth $196. In less than a week the stitching game out. The leather split &amp; now the enamel on the logo fell out.

14,The RealReal,Andi,"I'm in Canada and when you open the browser it asked if i wanted to shop in CND, i said yes.  I thought the pricing was all in Canadian Dollars, but when i compared my receipt with my credit card statement it was two different prices.  The credit card statement shows the conversion from USD to CDN....i thought it was already giving me the total Canadian value when it prompted me at the beginning.

2,The RealReal,customer,"I was happy with most of my purchases, but a blazer I purchased is terribly stained. It was described as ""minor discoloration"" and could not be seen in the photos.

3,The RealReal,ChannyA,"I was *mostly* satisfied with my first purchase, an LV belt. The one photo given showed of the belt coiled up, but it would useful to have more pics of the entire product, meaning the inside of the belt, and the belt fully extended, both sides. Even though in the product description, it mentioned signs of wear and tear, when I received the belt in person it was slightly disappointing, as there were quite a few stains/watermarks, and the belt itself was not straight, but severely curved/distorted because of previous owners' usage. It would have been nice to know this before purchasing the product.",105,3,"August 23, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=8

2,The RealReal,Terra,"Happy with my item, less happy with the discrepancy between the website states for shipping (UPS) and what the real real actually uses: DHL with USPS last mile delivery. This was a problem because USPS doesn’t deliver to my home address (and TRR won’t let you ship to a PO Box, which is how I get USPS mail). I tried to talk to the post office ahead of time but they still marked it return to sender and practically sent it back. Glad I got it in the end but it was a headache and it sucks when a company states one carrier and uses another",110,3,"September 03, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=9

7,The RealReal,Tina Prioleau ,"I’ve been shopping on TheRealReal since the beginning- before commercials, before the masses knew of it. I’m still just as happy! Only once have I had an issue- I was sent a pair of shoes that were the wrong size (they had the wrong size quoted on the site)- I was very angry bc I needed the shoes for an event the following day, but since this was the first issue ever, I let it go. I don’t recommend consigning with them- my $1000 listed jacket only gave me a commission of a bit over $200! Never again will I consign. Otherwise, as usual, great shopping!",113,4,"September 07, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=9
8,The RealReal,Nichole Devolites,"I've been using The Real Real for years and I had enjoyed the process of being able to ship my items off for consignment so I don't have to do it myself.  At first, the process worked great and my items were posted quickly, getting back a fair amount.  Now, not only do I barely make any money for my high-priced items on the site, but the reps are pushy (I don't want them texting me, or to meet with a stranger to hand them my things), and I've noticed the estimators are rejecting items that are still in great condition AND are accepted brands, yet I will consistently see a much poorer version listed from someone else that is barely wearable.  It's sad to see this company take a turn for the worse.  On the purchasing side, I do notice the items are shipping a lot faster, which is a great thing.",163,3,"August 31, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=9

18,The RealReal,customer,"I purchased a necklace on Sept 1 (10:42 pm) that was very important that it arrive by Friday (Sept 9). It was for the mother of a child who just died and she was to wear it to a funeral on Saturday. It was confirmed by your team that it would arrive Friday or earlier.  Of course, it Is now showing it will be delivered Monday (after changing from Friday on the UPS website).  UPS is saying that TRR delivered it late to them.  When I call TRR, the first agent barely spoke English so she just kept repeating from a script. Once I got a local agent, she was downright awful.  Not helpful, apologetic or even remotely empathetic.  Basically the response was “too bad, so sad”. As of today, I don’t even see the item leaving the location from where the necklace originated. I’m guessing this is a scam as it is now SEVEN days after order.   Being from the Bay Area, I love to support local companies.  Unfortunately, this will be the first and last time I will buy from The Real Real. Likely, I will have to dispute with my credit card company. Interestingly, they charge your credit card immediately (not upon shipping).",215,1,"September 09, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=9

12,The RealReal,Alex Galindo,I bought this coat . Later to find out there was tissues in the pockets with dry mucus in them and a card from a funeral in it.  I’ve shop with the real real for some time never had this happen to me.  With the sensitive restrictions we come across with Covid you think that a high end consignment company that prides itself on quality would nail this concern on it customers by providing a overall inspection of its items sold to the public .Specially with the rise of monkey pox and Covid I had to quarantine this item from my house.  To later find out by the dry cleaners that this item will cost more to then the actual item cost. I’m disappointed with the real real . Please have your quality control department acknowledged this and take some responsibility these are sensitive times for us and we are all trying by good faith shop for items To help the planet and not have items end up impacting the environment.All the best AG,180,1,"September 08, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=11

I bought leather pants that were delivered with significant stains. I emailed immediately notifying them that there were significant stains and asking that they cover return postage. Included in my email were the full order and item details, and I was clear which item it was I had the issue with. Several days passed and then they replied asking which item I had the issue with. I replied quickly (referring to the info I’d already provided). Several more days… etc etc. they dragged their feet. When I followed up they then replied that I had missed the return window. They never in that whole time sent me a return shipping label. Multiple requests for them to review the decision didn’t yield any give.

So, I called this year, when the same thing occurred and spoke with a customer service rep named LUCIFER. That is the truth, or what he told me. He also told me I would receive a return call within 24-48 hours - that was six days ago...no calls, emails or response to my call.

5,The RealReal,Angry,"My experience is mixed. I love buying from TRR but I hate consigning my items with them. 2 of my items were lost in shipping when I requested TRR to return them back to me because they priced them waaay too low, which I'll get to in a moment. Well, it took me 6 TRR chats, 4 emails, and 2 phone calls during a span of 2 full months to finally get some compensation in...site credits! They wouldn't compensate me with real money, not only that they turned around and requested UPS to compensate them in real dollars for the lost item!?!? One of my items was real 1980s vintage dress retailed over $700 according to their own assessment, so you can image the anger.Second biggest problem I have is how low they priced some of my items, way below market resale value. I was literally making $6 - $8 per item, and you guessed it, some of them were real vintage footwear and bags from major brands!!! All in all, if they don't approve their customer service and figure out a better pricing/sharing system, I will no longer consign with TRR.",200,2,"September 08, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=14

6,The RealReal,Claudia,I ordered a pair of Chanel shoes advertised as a size 10. When it arrived I tried it on. It was extremely tight and my foot barely fit. I looked at the box and the size was 39 1/2. I guess that's a European size. I googled what it is in a US size and I got anywhere from a size 9 to 9 1/2. Definitely not my size. I tried to return it and was told it was not returnable. But it was false advertising! I should be able to return it and get my money back.,102,1,"September 08, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=15

8,The RealReal,R.C.,The bag I purchased was not on the model so hard to determine the size.  Description does say dimension but only measures from the widest part which is the top opening so it doesn’t even fit my phone when I put it in the bag.

10,The RealReal,Erin,I had clothing picked up for consigment in June and they were never listed on the site (though did receive an email confirmation they were received). They were never listed on the site and reached out to my consignment relations contact and she would never respond with any real idea on what was going on and never follow up with me. Reached out to the CS team online who were very unhelpful as well. Finally got in touch with someone over the phone and they said to email the clothing items over and she'll follow up within 7-10 days. Its been over 14 days now and I've heard nothing.,113,1,"September 07, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=16

Of course, the product selection is amazing and I always get a great deal on something I love. More than half of my wardrobe is from TRR, and it feels good to know it’s a sustainable way to get the look I want. One criticism would be their filters; the sizing is sometimes off and it can’t do something like clothing and shoe sizes at the same time...",90,5,"September 07, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=16

5,The RealReal,customer,"The item I ordered was described as ""Very Good. Minor discoloration at collar."" However when I received it, it was covered with little stains on the collar, arms/shoulder area and bottom hem. It's leather, which is impossible to clean, so I'm stuck with the stains.

6,The RealReal,Sophistihippie,"The product is mostly as described. Some interior staining was not conveyed in the photos or description. There was also some dirt and pet hair in the bag. I would think a preliminary surface clean would have happened. Instead, I took it upon myself to throughly clean the bag inside and out upon receiving it. I would have liked to see more care in packing the item. The bag should have been stuffed with tissue paper to prevent creasing. The item had a dust bag which was nice. Shipping took double the time promised and the box arrived beat up and the tape barely holding. It looked like it had been through something. For luxury items and the amount paid, I would expect better care in packing and shipping practices all around. The bag is in overall great shape and will be useable for years to come.",152,4,"September 07, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=17

Nearly 3 weeks later, the items are not listed:  No photos, no listing.  AND, the commissions listed are incorrect!  LESS than what is promised on the contract and email, and what was promised verbally.  That is jewelry.  The other items that I have on site were also misrepresented.  When the rep picked the goods up, I understood that I would be paid commissions based on the total value of items listed.  Instead I am paid tiny percentage per item: 20% per item, 30% per item...I would never have listed to get such a paltry amount.  The company was not upfront, and in my opinion is out of integrity.  I have contacted the representatives at least 6-8 times and nothing!!! BEWARE!!!",159,1,"September 07, 2022",US,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/therealreal.com?page=17

Shipping takes awhile (about a week before it actually shipped), but it was packed well and arrived quickly once shipped.One dress didn't fit (too large) which is unfortunate since my measurements were smaller than the clothing itself.The other dress the measurements were a lot smaller than mine, but I knew the dress had stretch so it fit.

4,The RealReal,customer,"Terrible experience. The button on my hat was missing, but in the pictures the button was still in tact. Also, because I’m Canadian, it gives you the option to shop in (cad) which is my currency, but when I buy the item that was 550$ it wasn’t in my currency, so I ended up paying 775$ and it gets even better, so I get a email saying I owe 175$ for shipping lol.

I purchased 3 items and one other item did come with tags even though it wasn't stated. So it did make me question the item that came without the tags even though it was stated. Besides that all three items are wonderful and quality/appearance/ wear is just as stated. I would use them again and would recommend to others.
